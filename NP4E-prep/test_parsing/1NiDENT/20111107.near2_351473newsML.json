Marco Sibaja WASHINGTON 1997-02-03 Peru's President Alberto Fujimori, fresh from an emergency weekend summit with the Japanese prime minister, met President Bill Clinton on Monday to discuss the handling of the hostage crisis in Lima. Neither side gave details of the discussion, but before the meeting Fujimori dismissed suggestions of any \"_ peace accord _\"with Marxist guerrillas who have held hostages at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima since December 17. \"_ Peru has paid too high a cost to impose law and order $... to throw it all overboard and give in to the extortion of a gaggle of human rights violators, _\"Fujimori, speaking in Spanish, told the Organization of American States. \"_ Some people are starting to talk about a peace accord. We Peruvians do not understand what they are talking about, since that idea presumes a reality that is not Peru's $... We do not understand what sort of peace accord they pretend (to impose) on a country that is living in peace. We are not going to accept such a peace agreement, _\"Fujimori said. Referring to the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels who were holding 72 hostages in Peru and demanding the release of jailed comrades, Fujimori added, \"_ There are no guerrillas or popular armies in Peru, there is only a people tired of living in poverty and violence, a people who want to work and get ahead in life. _\"Fujimori held a hastily-arranged emergency summit on Saturday in Toronto with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to discuss the hostage crisis. The two leaders agreed to push for direct talks with the rebels but ruled out conceding to the guerrillas' demand for the liberation of about 400 MRTA members jailed in Peru. The rebels have also demanded improved prison conditions, an overhaul of Peru's secret court system for people accused of terrorism and an end to Fujimori's free-market economic reforms. The leader of the MRTA, who is one of about 15 heavily-armed guerrillas occupying the mansion in an upscale Lima neighborhood, reiterated on Sunday that any government move to force them out would end in tragedy. \"_ We know (an assault by the Peruvian army) would be tragic for the gentlemen held captive here. We are sorry for them and for their families, _\"Nestor Cerpa Cartolino said in an interview with two Spanish newspapers. The rebels originally took more than 500 hostages during a cocktail party at the diplomatic mansion. The remaining 72 captives in the mined and booby-trapped residence include two Peruvian ministers, the Japanese and Bolivian ambassadors, about two dozen Japanese businessmen and Fujimori's brother.", "title": "USA : Peru's Fujimori meets Clinton on Lima hostages.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
