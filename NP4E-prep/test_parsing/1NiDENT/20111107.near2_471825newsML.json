James Craig LIMA 1997-03-27 Hostages in Peru began their 100th day in captivity on Thursday amid mounting optimism as manoeuvring to end the crisis dwindled in anticipation of the long Easter holiday weekend. Negotiations, broken off since March 12, are expected to resume early next week, when mediators are expected to present a proposal for ending the standoff, already the longest hostage crisis in Latin American history. \"_ It seems there will be talks again Monday or Tuesday, _\"Bolivia's acting ambassador told local CPN radio. Bolivia's Ambassador Jorge Gumucio is one of the hostages. Diplomatic and media circles in Lima were bubbling with speculation on Wednesday that an accord to secure the release of 72 dignitaries held by Marxist rebels at the Japanese ambassador's home was nearing. Mediators met with Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) hostage-takers for two hours in the diplomatic compound on Wednesday, apparently finalising details for fresh face-to-face talks between rebels and the government. Adding fuel to the optimistic climate, hostage takers reportedly have agreed to take aslyum in Cuba as part of a deal to end the crisis. In Tokyo, Kyodo news service reported the rebel leader Nestor Cerpa Cartolini has told the guarantors' the rebels are ready to take asylum in Cuba and that they have been flexible in their main demand of freedom for 450 jailed comrades. \"_ We will not go to the Dominican Republic. We accept going to Cuba, _\"Cerpa said, according_to sources close to the commission. Havana and Santo Domingo both have offered to grant the rebels safe haven as part of a crisis-ending accord. Local media speculated on Wednesday that a behind-the-scenes deal, masterminded by the three-man guarantors' commission overseeing talks to end the saga, was taking final shape. The daily La Republica said the deal, to be finalised next week, included the freedom of some low-ranking MRTA prisoners, an amnesty and ransom payment to the rebels, and asylum in Cuba or the Dominican Republic for the hostage-takers. Mediator and Canadian Ambassador Anthony Vincent added to that speculation when he visited the Cuban ambassador's home following a meeting with the hostage takers earlier in the day. Also present at the meeting was Red Cross representative and fellow guarantor Michel Minnig. Despite apparent momentum for such an asylum agreement, President Alberto Fujimori on Wednesday appeared to reaffirm his hard line against freeing jailed MRTA rebels. \"_ In Peru, there should be no terrorists walking around. There should be no free terrorists, _\"Fujimori told a cheering crowd in the highland town of Huancayo. \"_ Those who should be free are the authentic citizens who work for Peru. _\"Red Cross spokesman Steven Anderson said the hostages were closely following the speculation and debate over their fate from radios inside the residence. He said the Red Cross planned to take chocolate eggs into the residence for the hostages for Easter Sunday. Peruvians, whose festivities have been overshadowed by the hostage crisis since it began on Dec. 17, were again preparing to focus their religious holiday on the captives. The Roman Catholic bishop of Lima's neighbouring port Callao, Miguel Irizar, said a Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession would be held on Friday in honour of the captives. \"_ Let_'s hope that Easter ends with the freedom of all the hostages, because in a certain way, we also feel like prisoners in the Japanese ambassador's residence, _\"he said. Others planned Masses and candlelight vigils around the country to show solidarity with the hostages.", "title": "PERU : Peru hostage crisis enters 100th day amid optimism.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
