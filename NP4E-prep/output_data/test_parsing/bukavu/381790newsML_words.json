KINSHASA 1997-02-17 Zaire said on Monday its warplanes were bombing three key rebel-held towns in eastern Zaire and vowed to intensify the air war. \"Since this morning the FAZ (Zaire army) has been bombing Bukavu, Shabunda and Walikale, \"said a defence ministry statement in the capital Kinshasa. A senior defence ministry official said Goma, the biggest city in rebel hands, was next on the hit list. He also said the army had retaken Walikale, but it was not clear when. \"Walikale has already been retaken by the army. But we are only mopping up some pockets of resistance there, \"said the official, who asked not to be named. He told Reuters the planes were flying from Kisangani, the headquarters for Zaire's counter-offensive launched last month to retake a vast stretch of territory seized by Tutsi-led rebels who took up arms in October. \"It is a surgical operation aimed at the enemy's strategic and military targets, \"the defence ministry statement said of the bombings. It made no mention of casualties or damage. Civilians in the towns had been advised to move away from the targets to avoid being hit, it added. The medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF-Holland) said from the nearby city of Goma that at least nine people were killed and up to 37 wounded in a raid on Bukavu by three Zairean government jets on Monday.", "title": "ZAIRE : Zaire says three rebel towns hit in air offensive.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
