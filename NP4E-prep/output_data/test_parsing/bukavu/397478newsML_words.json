Mark Dodd DAR ES SALAAM 1997-02-24 Tanzania and South Africa's chiefs of defence forces said on Monday a political and not military solution was the key to ending Africa's latest war in Zaire despite a rapid rebel advance since October. Tanzania's chief of defence forces, General Robert Mboma and his South African counterpart, General George Meiring, were speaking in a joint interview with Reuters after Meiring arrived on a four-day official visit to Tanzania. Until South Africa abolished racial apartheid laws, Pretoria had remained an arch foe of the east African nation that trained and housed the guerrilla fighters of the African National Congress, now the ruling party since all-race elections in 1994. The war in Zaire, Africa's third largest country, pits the country's notoriously ill-disciplined army against Rwandan-backed rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, is more a political than military upheaval, said Meiring. He added : \"I think the problems will not be solved militarily, they must be solved politically and diplomatically, inside Zaire. \"Meiring, South Africa's first post-apartheid chief of defences forces, is visiting Tanzania to discuss bilateral defence cooperation. The head of Africa's best equipped and trained military force described Zaire's ragged army, routed from a large swath of territory in eastern Zaire since October, as characterised by a \"lack of will to resist. \"On Sunday, the Belgian who leads an estimated 300 foreign mercenaries helping Zaire to fight Kabila's rebellion, said rebel forces currently held the upper hand. Christian Tavernier also accused Uganda of supporting the rebels, fighting to overthrow President Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's president of 31 years. The rebels $-- who Zaire says are backed by Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda $-- have advanced quickly from the east on several fronts, blunting an army counter-offensive launched from Zaire's third city of Kisangani on January 20. Mboma supported Meiring's military assessment of the Zaire war but said it was wrong to brand Africa's latest and most explosive conflict a guerrilla war. \"Although normally you connect the rebels with guerrilla fighting, in these operations they 're advancing just like a conventional war. What we call the rebels, they 're just employing conventional tactics $-- and they 're getting ground, \"he said. The two commanders were sceptical about prospects that mercenary-backed air strikes against the rebels could change the tide of fortune for Zaire's retreating army. \"Sporadic air strikes without proper coordination with infantry on the ground would achieve little if any gains for Zaire, \"said Meiring a veteran of South Africa's war against then Cuban and Soviet-backed government in Angola. Last week, Zaire used jets and helicopter gunships to bombard rebel-held centres of Bukavu, Shabunda and Walikale but the rebels said the air raids made no major gains. Mboma, head of the Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF), said the only results of Zaire's air strikes so far had been the random bombing of civilian targets. \"Here, the rebels did n't suffer any casualties. So there was no (strategic) impact. It seems the air power they 're (Zaire) using $-- they do n't do much reconnaissance. They do n't know where the rebels are, \"he said. \"I believe you have to use air power in connection with infantry $-- it must be coordinated. I do n't think there is any coordination with the government forces on the ground. The government forces on the ground seem to be too weak, \"Mboma added. South African President Nelson Mandela said on Monday that he and other African leaders would meet President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire on March 19 in a new bid to end Zaire's burgeoning civil war.", "title": "TANZANIA : Generals say political solution key to Zaire war.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
