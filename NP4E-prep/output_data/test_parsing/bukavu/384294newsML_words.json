Peter Smerdon NAIROBI 1997-02-18 Aid workers said on Tuesday at least six people were killed in a raid by government jets on the eastern Zairean town of Bukavu and at least 500 people fled to safer areas. Military sources in the region meanwhile told Reuters eight people were killed and scores were wounded in another raid by Zairean government planes on Monday on the town of Shabunda. Revising his initial figure of nine dead in Mondays raid on Bukavu, Marcel van Soest, head of the agency Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) in the rebel headquarters city of Goma, said at least six were killed. \"The final figure as of now is six dead for sure in Bukavu but probably a few more. But not nine as we had in our initial report from our staff there, \"he told Reuters by telephone. \"Following the raid, the first group of at least 500 people, but probably more than that, left Bukavu. We had expected more people to leave on Tuesday but so far have no word on that. \"The 500 fled despite appeals on rebel-run radio for calm. Van Soest said some 20 people were lightly wounded in the lakeside town and the rest were badly hurt. A foreign aid worker said among the dead were a child about 14 months old and a woman. He said bombs gouged holes three metres (10 feet) deep in the main market and governors residence, where Kabila has stayed. The Zairean defence ministry said its planes pounded the rebel-held towns of Bukavu, Shabunda and Walikale on Monday and a senior official said Goma city was next on the hit list. \"Goma is quiet today. The population is very alert but there is no panic and not too much worry, \"van Soest said. Rebel forces in Goma have anti-aircraft batteries captured from government troops who fled the city in November. Military sources who declined to be identified but follow the war in eastern Zaire confirmed government planes bombed a market in Shabunda on Monday and said at least eight people were killed and scores were wounded. There was no word on casualties in Walikale, where the senior Zairean defence official said the air raids were directed at \"pockets of resistance \". The government has said its troops retook the town from rebels, who say it remains in their hands. Mondays was the first air raid confirmed independently since the rebels launched their revolt last October and seized a large swath of territory bordering on Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania. The air raid took a government counter-offensive, which had been faltering, symbolically to the heart of the revolt but military analysts said Kinshasa had few other ways to hit back. Rebel leader Laurent Kabila threatened on Tuesday to attack Kisangani airbase, from where the planes took off on Monday. \"These are terrorist actions. And we are going to get ready to take the war precisely to the place from where the bombers took off, \"Kabila said in a brief interview broadcast on French LCI television.", "title": "KENYA : Six killed in Zaire air raid, hundreds flee Bukavu.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
