Arthur Malu-Malu KINSHASA 1997-02-17 Zaire's government on Monday rejected a ceasefire with rebels who have captured much of the country's east and instead launched the first reported air raids against rebel-held towns, killing at least nine people and wounding up to 37 in one town. \"The government stresses that it can not accept a ceasefire with unidentified belligerents, \"Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda said in a statement issued just before he met U.N. special envoy Mohammed Sahnoun, who is trying to end the war. At the same time, Zaire stepped up its counter-offensive against Tutsi-led rebels who have made large territorial conquests since taking up arms last October. The bombing of Bukavu, where the dead were reported, was the first government aerial attack confirmed by independent sources since rebels launched a military campaign last October and seized a large swath of territory in the vast central African nation. Zaire said on Monday its warplanes were bombing three key rebel-held towns in its eastern border provinces and that the raids would increase in intensity. \"Since this morning the FAZ (Zaire army) has been bombing Bukavu, Shabunda and Walikale, \"said a defence ministry statement in the capital Kinshasa. The medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF-Holland) said from the nearby rebel-held city of Goma that at least nine people were killed and up to 37 wounded in a raid on Bukavu by three Zairean government jets on Monday. Marcel van Soest, head of MSF-Holland in Goma, told Reuters by telephone that his staff had counted the dead and wounded at a local hospital in Bukavu. \"According to our people on the ground, who are currently working in the hospital treating the wounded, there are nine confirmed dead and 37 wounded, \"he said. \"Of the wounded, between 15 and 20 were mild cases and the rest were serious, \"he added. The government accuses the rebels of waging a proxy war for Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda $-- which deny involvement. The statement implied Zaire could consider a truce with the neighbouring states. \"Any ceasefire with the regular armies of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi must be linked to the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Zaire, \"the statement said. Zaire used the occasion of the U.N. mission to blame the world body for a threat by rebel leader Laurent Kabila to attack Tingi Tingi refugee camp near the city of Kisangani. It said a statement by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last week that Zaire was arming exiled Hutu hardliners among some 200,000 camp dwellers gave rebels the pretext to threaten a raid. U.N. officials said they saw Zairean military supplies being unloaded. \"The Zaire government demands that the Security Council remove from Zairean territory all Rwandan refugees \"including ex-Rwandan soldiers and their militia allies, it added. The war in eastern Zaire is intertwined with the ethnic conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda. The Hutu army and civilian militias massacred up to 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994 before fleeing en masse into Zaire. Hutu hardliners in refugee camps in Zaire plotted revenge attacks on the Tutsi-led government that later took power in Rwanda, stoking tensions in the region. Meanwhile, Zaire's ethnic-Tutsis took up arms in October after local authorities said they would expel them to their ancenstral homeland in Rwanda. The rebels went on to seize vast tracts of borderland, putting Zaire's rag-tag army to flight and forcing the government to recruit foreign mercenaries for a counter-attack. Sahnoun, a veteran Algerian diplomat, is trying to untangle Africa's most complex running conflict on behalf of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity. He met ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko, who is battling cancer at the same time as struggling to keep his 31-year hold on power in the vast Central African nation. Sahnoun made no statement as he emerged from the talks with Kamnda, who is also a deputy prime minister. He then went to meet Defence Minister General Lukulia Bolongo before further talks with Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo.", "title": "ZAIRE : Zaire planes bombs rebels as U.N. seeks war's end.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
