Gerald Akilimani GOMA, Zaire 1997-02-18 Thousands of residents fled the eastern Zairean city of Bukavu on Tuesday after at least 19 people were killed in raids by government warplanes on three rebel-held centres. Aid workers said panic-stricken residents carrying a few belongings on their heads fled on Tuesday for safer areas outside the city in the wake of at least 500 who left on Monday. \"There is a continuous flow of movement from Bukavu. It does not exceed perhaps 20 percent of the population but it is in the thousands, \"said Marcel van Soest, the head of Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) in the eastern rebel headquarters city of Goma. \"People in panic are fleeing in all directions, \"another aid worker said. They pulled out despite appeals on rebel-run radio for calm. Zairean government radio has told people to leave rebel centres. But another foreign aid worker in Bukavu said overall the movement was not very significant as only some people from poorer districts on the edges of the city left. Witnesses said most streets in the centre were deserted and many people remained indoors in case of any new air attacks. Despite a defence ministry official in Kinshasa saying the air war by the government intensified with fresh bombardments on Bukavu, Shabunda and Walikale on Tuesday morning, no independent confirmation of new raids was available after dusk on Tuesday. Aid workers in Bukavu and the rebel headquarters city of Goma, which was said by Kinshasa to be next on its aerial hit list, reported shortly after nightfall there were no new raids. Aid agencies put the toll from Mondays air raid on Bukavu at 11 dead and 36 wounded after one casualty died of his wounds. Hospital sources said all those killed on Monday were civilians. They said earlier reports on Tuesday from agencies of up to 13 dead in Bukavu were inaccurate. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it and the Zairean Red Cross had evacuated a total of nine dead and 37 wounded from the air raid to Bukavu Central Hospital on Monday. Military sources in the region meanwhile told Reuters eight people were killed and scores were wounded in another raid by Zairean government planes on Monday on the town of Shabunda. Van Soest said 20 people were lightly wounded in the lakeside city and other 17 were badly hurt. A foreign aid worker said among the dead were a 14-month-old child and a woman. He said bombs gouged holes three metres (10 feet) deep in the main market and near the governors residence, where rebel leader Laurent Kabila has stayed but he was not there on Monday. Other aid workers said four planes, believed to be MiG-21s, dropped four bombs on Bukavu. One exploded near the border with Rwanda and another crashed into a junction in the city centre. \"The old leopard can bite, \"said a civil servant in Goma, referring to ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko who has vowed to defeat the rebellion threatening to tear apart Africas third largest country. There was no word on casualties in Walikale, where the senior Zairean defence official said the air raids were directed at \"pockets of resistance \". The government has said its troops retook the town from rebels, who say it remains in their hands. Mondays was the first air raid confirmed independently since rebels began their military campaign last October, seizing a swath of eastern Zaire some 1,000 km (600 miles) long bordering on Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania. Kabila threatened on Tuesday to attack the government's base at Kisangani city, from where the planes took off on Monday.", "title": "ZAIRE : Thousands flee east Zaire city after air raids.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
