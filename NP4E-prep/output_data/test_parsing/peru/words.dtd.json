James Craig LIMA 1997-03-28 Peru's Marxist rebels cast doubts on reports of an imminent deal and President Alberto Fujimori said problems remained, tempering optimism on Friday that an end to the 101-day Lima hostage crisis was in sight. In Tokyo, Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Friday he did not foresee dramatic progress soon in talks between the Peruvian government and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels holding 72 hostages at the Japanese ambassador's home in Lima. \"I ca n't say with confidence that there will be significant progress, \"Hashimoto told reporters. \"I am not optimistic, \"he said without elaborating. In Lima on Thursday, 100 days after rebels stormed the residence, there was a sense of optimism that a negotiated solution could be near. Both Fujimori and MRTA rebels said the two sides moved closer to a solution to the siege but key issues remained to be resolved as they prepared for fresh talks next week. \"The sides are getting closer but the main demand for the release of prisoners still has to be addressed, \"Comrade Alejandro, an MRTA military leader in Peru's central jungle, told Reuters. The MRTA stormed the diplomatic compound Dec. 17 and took hostages at a cocktail party to demand the freedom of some 450 jailed comrades, a demand the government has flatly rejected. Fujimori put an upbeat spin on the standoff, in keeping with a growing sense in Peru that momentum is building for an accord to end Latin America's longest hostage siege. \"Even though, naturally, difficulties still exist, we are getting closer, \"he told local television. Direct talks between the government and MRTA $-- broken off since March 12 $-- are expected to resume Monday or Tuesday amid reports the rebels have agreed to take asylum in Cuba as part of a broader crisis-ending deal. But the hostage-takers on Thursday called local media reports detailing a deal purportedly made by the two sides \"simple speculation. \"Nonetheless, even Fujimori's opponents in Congress saw a quick end to the crisis. \"The way negotiations are progressing, I believe they can come up with a solution in the short term, Congressman Alejandro Santa Maria Silva of the Aprista party told Reuters. Diplomats, legislators and analysts say that the release of jailed rebels should not be an unsurmountable hurdle when face-to-face contacts resume. Two mediators in the talks met on Thursday with rebels for 90 minutes but made no comment to reporters afterward. But the president boosted growing optimism in Lima that a solution to the siege was in sight, saying he was confident the energetic work of the talks' guarantors, hammering out a deal acceptable to both sides, \"is going to bear fruit. \"Fujimori also hinted he still had some differences with Tokyo on how to end the crisis. \"Perhaps we live the situation here more intimately. In Japan $... there is a distance that does not allow a precise perception of what is going on and what might happen, \"he said. Rebels issued a statement saying a \"peaceful solution for the crisis is in the government's hands and will come about if they address our demands. \"The MRTA has said the group would negotiate a reduced number of freed comrades as long as they were high-ranking rebels. An MRTA international spokeswoman, however, hinted the group would also accept the release of ill prisoners. \"Now it's the turn for the government to show its good faith by releasing the sick prisoners. That would signal a positive turn in negotiations, \"Norma Velazco said in an interview published on the MRTA's Internet web site.", "title": "PERU : Peru, rebels see obstacles amid crisis progress.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
