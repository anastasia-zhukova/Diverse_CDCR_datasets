James Craig LIMA 1997-02-16 Three rounds of talks between Peru's government and leftist rebels holding 72 men captive have made little progress and mediators were trying to keep the discussions alive as the siege entered its 61st day on Sunday. Canadian Ambassador Anthony Vincent, one of the mediators, said the government and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) agreed on Saturday to allow mediators to \"elaborate a proposal that will facilitate the continuation of the preliminary conversations. \"In a brief statement, Vincent said only that talks to end the siege at the Japanese ambassador's home would continue \"as soon as possible. \"The face-to-face preliminary talks aim to fix an agenda for future negotiations to end the crisis, which began when the MRTA stormed the residence Dec. 17. Saturday's three-hour meeting at a Red Cross safe house was the third round of talks in a week between President Alberto Fujimori's negotiator Domingo Palermo and MRTA No. 2 Rolly Rojas, who goes by the nom de guerre \"El Arabe \"( The Arab). Also present at the meetings between Palermo and Rojas were Vincent and fellow mediators Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Luis Cipriani, Red Cross representative Michel Minnig and Japan's talks observer Teruke Terada. Saturday's statement from the guarantors contrasted with one read after a meeting Friday, when mediators said the two sides had made \"real progress. \"Fujimori was away from Lima for Saturday's talks on a visit to Peru's central jungle province of Satipo to inaugurate two bridges. In a speech monitored on local radio, he did not comment on the hostage situation. He also was out of town Friday and Tuesday, when the two sides broke a deadlock and met for the first time since Dec. 28 when face-to-face talks stalled on the rebels' demand of freedom for 400 jailed comrades. Fujimori has adamantly refused to discuss the issue. An MRTA statement sent to Reuters via electronic mail said the crisis \"is being prolonged not through the intransigence of the (rebel) command but through the intolerance of the Fujimori dictatorship and its military allies. \"The communique, signed by a rebel spokeswoman in Germany, accused Fujimori of preparing a \"violent solution \"and added that the government knew the MRTA would not relinquish its demand for the release of comrades in jails whose \"inhuman conditions $... are a monument to infamy. \"All three talks last week were held at the rented house across the street from the diplomatic compound where rebels have been holed up since Dec. 17, when about 15 heavily armed guerrillas stormed a party and seized hundreds of hostages. The band of Cuban-inspired rebels has released all but the 72 captives still held, including Fujimori's brother Pedro, two Peruvian cabinet ministers, the envoys of Japan and Bolivia and about two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats. After two months in captivity, worries about the strain on the mainly middle-aged hostages have grown. The International Human Rights Federation called on the MRTA Saturday to follow a Red Cross recommendation and release any hostage whose health shows signs of deteriorating. The group's vice president, Francisco Soberon, slammed the hostage-taking \"which puts at risk the lives of those who are being unjustly held. \"The Red Cross is treating many hostages for hypertension, digestive problems and depression. They have spent Christmas, New Year and now Valentine's Day away from their families. Wives and girlfriends gave the Red Cross boxes of chocolates for the men on Friday and 72 Peruvian couples were married at a mass wedding to show solidarity with them. The Red Cross gave details on Saturday of its mammoth aid operation to the hostages inside the residence. So far it has enabled the captives to send 2,238 messages to their families, while relatives had sent 2,583 missives into the compound. It also has delivered 1,201 packages of clothing, 12,914 meals $-- including 4,651 Japanese dishes $-- 3,454 litres (912 gallons) of hot water for tea and coffee, 16,180 litres (4,274 gallons) of drinking water and 509 copies of sports newspapers.", "title": "PERU : Peru mediators will seek to spur hostage talks.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
