Jason Webb LIMA 1997-02-23 The 72 hostages held in the Japanese ambassador's mansion in Peru began their 68th day in captivity on Sunday with no end in sight to their ordeal after the president said talks to free them were still in their preliminary phase. Face-to-face talks on Thursday between Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) leader Nestor Cerpa were \"very constructive \", but the Marxist rebel leader harangued the government negotiator, President Alberto Fujimori said. \"We can not predict how many more weeks these discussions will take, \"he said on Saturday during a tour of a poor Lima district with talks observer Terusuke Terada from Japan. \"We are still at a preliminary stage in the conversations. We will make every effort to achieve a fast, peaceful solution. \"Fujimori said Cerpa spoke for nearly an hour, putting forth \"his point of view, his diverse proposals, even criticising the government. \"Government negotiator Domingo Palermo laid out the official position, but no agenda was agreed for upcoming talks. Fujimori said he hoped Cerpa would personally take part in the talks when they resume on Monday at 11 a.m. (1600 GMT). The fact the rebel leader attended the fourth round of negotiations on Thursday was a \"small advance \"in the search for a peaceful solution to the crisis, Fujimori said. \"This was a great advantage because there was no need to use the red phone, \"he said, referring to a phone link between the residence and the talks site in a safe house across the street. In the first three meetings, the MRTA was represented by Cerpa's deputy, who used the phone to consult his chief. Thursday's meeting was the first time Cerpa had left the besieged residence since he and his band of well-armed guerrillas stormed the building on Dec. 17 during a cocktail party to celebrate the Japanese Emperor's birthday. The rebels are demanding freedom for 400 jailed comrades. The government has said it refuses to consider the idea but is willing to allow the hostage-takers to seek asylum abroad. Earlier on Saturday, Fujimori insisted Peru-Japan relations were on a solid footing despite the crisis. \"The cooperation between the government of Peru and the government of Japan at all levels continues normally, \"he said. Japan has been broadly supportive of Fujimori. But it has criticised his government for police provocation of the rebels and there is strong speculation Tokyo's pressure has kept Peru from carrying out a military solution to end the crisis. Troops manning the roadblock across a street leading to the siege site barred the way on Saturday to two white-scarfed members of Argentine human rights group Mothers of Plaza de Mayo. The Mothers, who are famous for their struggle against Argentina's military rulers in the 1970s, have been invited to mediate in the crisis by the MRTA and said they would return to try again at the residence the next day. But Fujimori has refused to acknowledge their presence in Peru. The three current mediators $-- Canada's envoy Anthony Vincent, Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani and Red Cross representative Michel Minnig $-- went into the mansion in Lima's smart San Isidro district without speaking to reporters. One former hostage, Dr. Victor Lucero, allayed fears some of the captives might be seriously ill. Lucero, who has visited the residence since his release, said the hostages were suffering from the same manageable typical disorders of middle-aged men that they had when they were free. \"They are all in good shape, generally speaking, \"he told local television, adding that the captives were getting all the medicine they needed.", "title": "PERU : Peru's Fujimori says hostage talks still young.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
