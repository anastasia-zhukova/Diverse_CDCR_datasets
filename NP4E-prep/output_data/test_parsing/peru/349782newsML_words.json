Saul Hudson LIMA 1997-02-02 The Peruvian government has launched a campaign to help other silent victims of the hostage crisis at the Japanese ambassador's residence : the captives' families. President Alberto Fujimori, whose brother Pedro is one of 72 men still being held by the armed Marxist guerrillas, has assigned a team of eight psychologists to families agonizing under the strain of the six week deadlock. \"I share the moments of anguish, anxiety and suffering you are living through, \"Fujimori told relatives invited to Government Palace earlier this week. The family members of the hostages, who include some of Peru's top officials and a group of Japanese businessmen, also now have access to a 24-hour telephone hotline to talk about a crisis that has prompted frighteningly tough words from both the government and the rebels holding the men prisoner. \"The uncertainty is terrible. You do n't know what might be happening, \"said Martha de San Roman, whose husband, Peru's deputy minister for energy and mines, is among the captives. Psychologists say the families of the remaining hostages, who have watched hundreds of other prisoners walk free at earlier points in the drama, are clinging to little more than hopes and memories to get through their ordeal. \"It is as if I have just fallen in love, \"San Roman said. \"I ca n't stop thinking about him. \"Beatriz de Gumucio, who had not been separated from her husband, Bolivian ambassador Jorge Gumucio, in 37 years before the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement guerrillas seized the residence on Dec. 17, has asked local television stations to play love ballads in the background when they show her husband's photograph. The women have expressed their affection for the captives by exchanging private notes through the Red Cross, broadcasting messages of hope on radio programmes heard by their husbands and even singing nostalgic songs to them across police lines at the besieged compound. All of this is a way of fighting off the real fear that the men could die, according to psychologist Mariano Querol. Those fears may have deepened over the weekend when rebel leader Nestor Cerpa Cartolino, reacting to an emergency summit in Canada between Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Fujimori, reiterated warnings that any use of force would end in tragedy for the hostages. \"We know (an assault by the Peruvian army) will be tragic for the gentlemen held captive here. We are sorry for them and for their families, \"Cerpa said in an interview with Spanish newspapers El Pais and La Vanguardia. As officials struggle to resolve the standoff, the families are struggling to cope with life robbed of husbands and fathers. For the wives, the strain of suddenly becoming single parents is showing. They \"suddenly take on a double role. They are in charge and have to field all the children's questions, \"psychologist Max Hernandez said. San Ramon said she was worried about her three teenage sons who had started \"talking less and fighting more because of the stress. \"The counsellors and psychologists now helping the families warn that even if there is a happy end to the hostage crisis, scars from the episode will last for years $-- especially among the children. And the wives can expect their extra family responsibility to continue as their husbands seek to readapt to freedom. The government \"is trying to prepare them so that they can provide stability for their (freed) relatives and help them reintegrate into their normal daily lives, \"Women's Minister Miriam Schenone said.", "title": "PERU : Families get support as Peru hostage drama drags on.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
