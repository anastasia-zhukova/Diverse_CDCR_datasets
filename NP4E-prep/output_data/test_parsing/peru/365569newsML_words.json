Paul Mylrea LONDON 1997-02-09 Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, almost two months into a stand-off with Marxist rebels, said on Sunday he remained calm and was optimistic he could reach a peaceful solution. In an interview in London, Fujimori also said that despite the strains and stresses of the crisis caused by the rebels' seizure of hostages at the Japanese ambassador's Lima residence, he was convinced terrorism was on the wane in Peru. \"I am taking this problem with objectivity, rationality and of course, with much-needed calm, \"Fujimori told Reuters. \"I am optimistic that I will succeed in releasing all the hostages safe and in good health. \"Fujimori, who said he hoped to start preliminary talks to resolve the hostage crisis next week, is in London for a conference to boost trade and investment flows between Britain and Peru. In a wide ranging interview, he said he believed the crisis would not affect his efforts to reform Peru's economy and reduce poverty. He said he was treating calmly the fact that two of his relatives, including his brother Pedro, are among the 75 people still being held hostage by Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels in Lima. \"It does n't make it more or less difficult $... I am managing with the same approach as I would with no relatives there. \"The main principle, the main goal is to keep the hostages safe and maintain the national security of Peru, \"he said. The MRTA rebels stormed into the residence on December 17, originally taking hostage more than 500 VIPs. Many have been freed, but the rebels still hold government ministers, about two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats as well as the Japanese and Bolivian ambassadors and Fujimori's brother. But Fujimori said he believed the MRTA and the Maoist Shining Path were no longer the force they had been before their leaders were captured early in his first five-year term. \"Both terrorist groups have almost disappeared. They are disorganised, \"he said. Fujimori also rejected criticism of Peru's human rights record and the condition of its jails. The MRTA rebels' main demand is the release of 400 of their comrades from prison. Fujimori said the armed forces were firmly under his control and described the 1992 murder of 10 university students, known as La Cantuta crimes, as an \"isolated, hidden-up problem \"that had been dealt with. The president also said he was pleased with economic progress, saying that even though there was still much poverty in the country, it was gradually falling. \"We expect in the next three years that extreme poverty will be reduced to half the rate we had in 1995, that is from 22 percent to 11 percent, \"he said. Fujimori, the 58-year-old son of Japanese immigrants whose marriage to Susanna Higuchi broke down after he was elected president, also gave a rare glimpse into his private moments, saying his children were the most important thing in his life and admitting he was seeking a girlfriend. Asked about his divorce, Fujimori, a former university rector and agronomist who swept to power in 1990 on the back of a wave of disgust with traditional politicians, said : \"Of course my kids regret this, me too, but life is like this. \"But I am fascinated and enthusiastic about my job. I like to be president and I like to see results in my office. That's why I am happy, optimistic and working with enthusiasm. \"Newspapers have reported him as saying he was looking for a girlfriend with good legs. Asked about the reports, he said : \"That's not true about the good legs, but what I should look for is some girl that may understand me personally and could enjoy what I am doing for my country. \"He admitted that finding the right person and starting a relationship was far from easy for a president surrounded by the cares and duties of office. He also gave no hint as to whether these problems would prevent him running for a third term of office in the year 2000. Fujimori was reelected with an overwhelming 64 percent of the vote in 1995. But despite constant travel across the country to open schools and public works projects, often donning typical regional costumes, his poll rating has since slipped. \"I am going to continue my job every day of the year until the year 2000, but I am not thinking of reelection yet, \"he said.", "title": "UK : Fujimori convinced terrorism is waning in Peru.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
