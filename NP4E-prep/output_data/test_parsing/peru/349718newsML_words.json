Walker Simon TORONTO 1997-02-02 Peru is looking for an asylum destination for hostage-takers in Lima, and Cuba, Guatemala and Costa Rica could be considered, Canadian diplomat Anthony Vincent said on Sunday. Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has mentioned safe passage out of the country as an option to resolve the crisis, if the rebels freed their captives and laid down their arms. Vincent, the Canadian ambassador to Peru and a mediator in the 47-day-old crisis at the Japanese ambassador's residence, told the Toronto Star that Canada and many other countries would be interested in finding a foreign destination for the Marxist rebels holding 72 captives. \"The Peruvians are obviously looking around, \"he told the newspaper, speaking hours after a Peru-Japan crisis summit in Toronto. \"The Cubans have behaved very correctly throughout this and they obviously would be very careful in deciding to take on this kind of role. \"Canadian media have speculated about Cuba's role as a haven for the rebel hostage-takers. Canadian External Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who met twice with Cuban leader Fidel Castro last week during an official visit to Havana, on Thursday did not rule out Cuba giving the rebels refuge. In the Toronto Star interview, Vincent did not elaborate on Guatemala and Costa Rica as potential destinations, nor did he say if the subject came up during summit talks between Fujimori and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. At a news conference with Fujimori on Saturday, Hashimoto was vague when questioned about foreign asylum for the rebels. He said all possibilities to resolve the crisis had been discussed. Vincent was one of the more than 500 initial hostages seized on Dec. 17 when Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels stormed the ambassador's residence during a garden reception honoring the Japanese emperor's birthday. Among the hostages freed early, Vincent has returned to the compound as an intermediary with the rebels, led by MRTA commander Nestor Cerpa. Peru's negotiations with the guerrillas are deadlocked over MRTA's demand that 400 jailed comrades, including Cerpa's wife, be freed. During the summit, Japan closed ranks with Peru in flatly rejecting this rebel demand. But in Washington on Saturday, Fujimori said in a Washington Post interview the rebels had \"implicitly \"agreed to drop the MRTA's demand to free the jailed rebels. The MRTA's international spokesman, Isaac Velazco, denied the group had implicitly dropped their main demand, but he said they had acknowledged they would not achieve all their demands.", "title": "CANADA : Peru said looking for third country to take rebels.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
