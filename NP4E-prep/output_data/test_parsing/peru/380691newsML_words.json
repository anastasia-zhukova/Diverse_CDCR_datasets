James Craig LIMA 1997-02-14 Peru's government and Marxist rebels holding 72 hostages at the Japanese ambassador's home in Lima agreed to meet again on Saturday after concluding a second round of crisis talks on Friday, mediators said. Canadian Ambassador Anthony Vincent, a member of a mediating panel overseeing talks, emerged from Friday's three-hour meeting to say the negotiations had made \"real progress \"toward ending the 59-day hostage crisis. He did not give a time for the restart of talks on Saturday. Reading from a statement, Vincent told reporters the government and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels on Friday had \"put forward their proposals for the contents of an agenda \"for definitive talks to end the crisis. \"So far, the agenda has not been agreed, \"he added. Minutes earlier, a white Red Cross car had ferried an MRTA guerrilla, believed to be No. 2 leader Rolly Rojas, from the safe house being used for negotiations across the street to the diplomatic compound. Friday's meeting was the second since Tuesday, when the two sides broke a deadlock by meeting face-to-face for the first time since Dec. 28. A band of about 15 MRTA rebels have held the hostages since Dec. 17, when they stormed a cocktail party and seized hundreds of guests. Most have since been released by rebels. Among those still held in the mined and booby-trapped residence are two Peruvian ministers, the Japanese and Bolivian envoys, about two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats and Fujimori's brother, Pedro. As Friday's talks got underway, President Alberto Fujimori arrived back in Lima from a trip to the northeastern jungle town of Pucallpa. During the trip, Fujimori refused to comment on the hostage situation. The MRTA has refused to back down on its main demand of freedom for some 400 imprisoned rebels in exchange for the hostages' lives ; the government refuses to discuss the issue. Tuesday's meeting produced a pledge for further talks but little more apparent progress toward a solution, although Palermo described it as \"quite positive. \"Speaking publicly about the meeting for the first time on Thursday, he said the government was \"very worried \"about the situation, but added : \"We will continue our work, and then we hope to have results. \"Also present at Friday's talks were Vincent's fellow mediators Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Luis Cipriani and Red Cross representative Michel Minnig as well as Japan's crisis talks' observer, Teruke Terada. The hostages, all men and mostly middle-aged, have spent Christmas, New Year's and now Valentine's Day as hostages. A few miles from the siege, in the \"Park of Love \"on the Pacific coast, 72 couples were married at a mass wedding to show solidarity with the 72 captives. \"We are here to tell them (hostages) they are not alone, \"said Mayor Oscar Barron at the end of the ceremony held beneath a huge statue of two lovers embracing, called \"The Kiss. \"Hostages also enjoyed Valentine's Day chocolates sent into the residence by loved ones, although some probably did not indulge as they have taken to dieting and exercising to lose weight, according to doctors. \"Although some of them go jogging on the second floor, because of the lack of physical exercise, some have put on weight and have decided to go on a diet, \"said Dr. Miguel Sanchez, who was among the first groups of hostages to be released. \"Some have lost 13 to 18 pounds (6 to 8 kg). \"A heart specialist, Sanchez told Peruvian television that on his latest visit on Thursday he found the hostages calm and in generally good health.", "title": "PERU : Peru, rebels set new hostage talks for Saturday.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
