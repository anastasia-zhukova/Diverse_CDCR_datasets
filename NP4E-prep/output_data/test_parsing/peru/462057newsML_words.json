James Craig LIMA 1997-03-23 The number of people killed in political violence in Peru fell in 1996 but the year ended on a human rights low with the mass hostage-taking on Dec. 17 by Marxist rebels, a local human rights umbrella group said. The National Human Rights Coordinator, in a report obtained by Reuters on Sunday, condemned the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement's (MRTA) takeover of the Japanese ambassador's home as \"reprehensible \"and in violation of \"principles established under international humanitarian law. \"\" This reprehensible act, although isolated, reminds us that even though they are weak and without public support, subversive groups continue to operate in different parts of the country, \"the group said in its 1996 report on human rights in Peru. About 20 MRTA rebels continue to hold 72 dignitaries and businessmen 96 days after storming the mansion in Lima's upscale San Isidro district to demand the freedom of some 450 jailed comrades. The crisis has become the longest hostage siege in Latin American history. The report said 292 Peruvians were killed last year in acts of political violence, including battles between guerrillas and security forces, murders, extrajudicial killings, bombings and other acts. The figure was down from 527 slayings in 1995 and off dramatically from 3,087 in 1991 and 2,893 in 1992, at the height of Peru's guerrilla conflicts. Among last year's victims were 137 civilians, 91 suspected rebels and 64 members of the country's security forces, it said. Wars unleashed by the Shining Path and MRTA have killed 30,000 people and cost $25 billion in infrastructure damage in this poor Andean country since 1980. \"In 1996, we saw a change in the actions of the subversive groups, \"the report said. \"We see this in the increase in armed propaganda actions and the decrease in select killings and attacks. \"Despite the headline-grabbing MRTA attack, the larger Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group remained Peru's top human rights violator in 1996, accounting for 123 of the 142 selective murders registered, it said. The Shining Path continues to focus its actions in the coca-producing upper Huallaga River valley but has also killed in the capital, including the March 1996 slaying of community leader Pascuala Rosado. Despite a spreading peace, 42 percent of Peruvians last year continued to live under state-of-emergency rule covering 18.5 percent of the national territory, the report said. It said the government also has failed to address problems faced by victims of 17 years of war, including thousands of refugees. While arrests, disappearances and extrajudicial slayings on the part of the security forces were down in 1996, torture and beatings of detainees are \"inflicted with great frequency \"during investigations, it added. \"These illegal acts are tolerated, covered up and rarely punished. \"Peru's prisons house 22,210 inmates, including thousands accused of terrorism and treason. The coordinator said 110 people unjustly jailed on those charges were freed but hundreds more remain behind bars, it added.", "title": "PERU : Hostage crisis stains 1996 rights record in Peru.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
