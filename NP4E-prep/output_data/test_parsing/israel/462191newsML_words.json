JERUSALEM 1997-03-23 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday Israel would not suspend peace talks with the Palestinians over an Islamist suicide bomb attack that killed three women in Tel Aviv on Friday. \"Well, I 'm not suspending talks because our people are meeting with their people but the first item on the agenda is the fulfillment of the Palestinian obligation to fight terrorism. They have to start complying with that or else we ca n't move, \"Netanyahu told CNN cable television. Netanyahu was responding to one of his interviewers who asked him if he would, as one of his aides had hinted earlier in the day, halt political talks. The Israeli prime minister appeared after meeting for several hours with key government ministers on a reaction to the bombing, which a caller to Israeli police claimed was the responsibility of the militant group Hamas. A statement released after the meeting said : \"The government of Israel demands from the Palestinian Authority that it uphold its commitments to fight terror and violence, as a necessary step, to furthering the political process. \"It demanded, but did not specifically make a condition, that the Authority increase security cooperation ; prevent incitement against Israel ; fight guerrilla organisations including their infrastructures ; arrest, try and punish \"terrorists \"; deal with Israelis extradition requests ; and confiscate illegal weapons.", "title": "ISRAEL : Israel will not suspend peace talks $- Netanyahu.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
