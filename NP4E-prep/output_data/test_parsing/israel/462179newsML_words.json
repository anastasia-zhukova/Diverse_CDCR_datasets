JERUSALEM 1997-03-23 Israel said on Sunday the Palestinian Authority was conditioning cooperation in fighting \"terror \"on a change in the political situation. \"Today and for several days the security mechanisms of the Palestinians have not cooperated with the General Security Services $-- the Shin Bet $-- in what is connected to foiling terrorist actions and in practise they have conditioned that on a change in the political situation, \"Major General Moshe Yaalon, head of military intelligence, told a news conference. Israeli army chief of staff, Lieutenant General Amnon Shahak, joined Yaalon in saying that clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protesters at the weekend near Palestinian-ruled enclaves could have been stopped sooner by the Authority and had been encouraged by some of its officials. \"The clashes between the mob and our soldiers were led according to our information by the Fatah organisation $... as far as we know encouraged by Jibril Rajoub himself and his apparatus. \"Fatah is the mainstream PLO faction. Shahak, asked if to defend itself Israel might retake West Bank cities it has handed to the Palestinians since signing a 1993 framework peace deal, said : \"I believe that all hope that this is not an option unless it will be necessary and I hope it will never be necessary. \"Asked to explain how Rajoub had a cordial meeting with Israeli Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani on Sunday after encouraging riots, Shahak said : \"Confusion is part of the process. \"Yaalon again repeated a charge, denied by the Authority, that Palestinian guerrilla groups had been given the impression they had a green light from the Palestinian Authority to commit attacks against Israel. He said the impression was given in meetings between Arafat and heads of guerrilla organisations beginning on March 9, after Arafat's return from an official visit to the United States. \"In light of the situation, we estimate that as long as Arafat does not cause the terrorist organisations to understand that there is no green light to commit attacks, we are expecting more attacks, \"he said. An Islamist suicide bomber killed three Israeli women and wounded scores of other people at a Tel Aviv sidewalk cafe on Friday. Yaalon said Arafat's forces had yet to crack down : disarm militants and destroy their infrastructure. The general said that in order for that to happen \"there is a need that they receive an order from Arafat himself. An order like that has still not been given \". A caller to Israeli police claimed responsibility in the name of the militant group Hamas for the Tel Aviv attack. Hamas threatened to launch further attacks if Israel went on building a Jewish settlement begun last week in Arab East Jerusalem at Jabal Abu Ghneim, known as Har Homa in Israel. Rajoub said after meeting Kahalani earlier on Sunday : \"The situation deteriorated after the attempt at (building) a settlement on Har Homa, something nobody needed. The government of Israel has to decide if it really wants peace and security or if it wants settlements, \"Rajoub told army radio. Both Rajoub and Kahalani described their meeting, scheduled before the bombing, as good. Kahalani's office said a hotline was established between the two officials. Rajoub vowed the Palestinians would \"take all necesssary steps \".", "title": "ISRAEL : Israel accuses PLO of linking security to politics.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
