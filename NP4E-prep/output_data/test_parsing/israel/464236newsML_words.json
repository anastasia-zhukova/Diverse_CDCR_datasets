WASHINGTON 1997-03-24 The White House said on Monday that Jordan's King Hussein was tentatively expected to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton on April 1 and denied that the middle east peace process was unravelling. \"I 'm told that we expect him here next Tuesday, \"White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters. Hussein had been scheduled to meet Clinton on March 18, but his visit was postponed after a Jordanian soldier shot dead seven Israeli girls near the Israel-Jordan border on March 13 and after Clinton had knee surgery on March 14. In addition to the killing of the Israeli girls, on Friday an Islamist suicide bomber killed three Israeli women at a Tel Aviv cafe on Friday. The bombing further injured an Israel-PLO relationship already strained over construction Israel launched last week for a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. Asked if the peace process was now unravelling, McCurry replied : \"No $... Manifestly the majority of Arabs and Jews want to see peace in that region. They have seen the benefits and the dividend of peace and they want leaders, and they want those who help the parties, to continue to make progress. \"\" They do n't want to see the cycle decend to violence and terror, which are the weapons of those who are enemies of peace, \"he said. \"We have to do everything within our auspices to thwart those who are attempting to undermine the process. \"In an effort to breathe new life into the peace process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak have all met Clinton in Washington over the past two months.", "title": "USA : Jordan's Hussein expected to visit U.S. April 1.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
