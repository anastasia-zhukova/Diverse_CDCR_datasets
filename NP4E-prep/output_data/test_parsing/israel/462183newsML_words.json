Howard Goller JERUSALEM 1997-03-23 Israel tightened security around its cities on Sunday and said it could partly suspend peace talks with the Palestinians following an Islamist suicide bombing and threats of more to come. Underscoring tensions, Israeli security forces shot and wounded two Palestinians at a roadblock near Jerusalem and fired teargas to disperse Palestinian protesters who hurled five petrol bombs at them near the West Bank town of Hebron, witnesses said. Three Palestinians were treated for teargas inhalation. Security forces threw up protective rings around Israeli cities which went ahead with carnivals for the Purim holiday marking the rescue of Jews from genocide in ancient Persia. A caller to Israeli police claimed responsibility in the name of the militant group Hamas for the killing of three Israeli women in Friday's bombing of a Tel Aviv cafe. Hamas threatened to launch further attacks if Israel went on building a Jewish settlement begun last week in Arab East Jerusalem. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep building and summoned his inner security cabinet to a meeting on Sunday after accusing Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority of having given Hamas the green light for the suicide bombing. Netanyahu's communications chief David Bar-Illan said the cabinet ministers would meet to decide how to proceed in talks with Arafat's Palestinian Authority $-- \"if at all \". \"There may be a suspension of at least any kind of political negotiations and a decision to concentrate only on security matters until we see some kind of cooperation from the Palestinians, \"Bar-Illan told Reuters. Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud party, was elected 10 months ago on a promise to pursue both peace and security. Now his peace talks are in crisis and the suicide bombers he vowed to repel have come back. \"Unless there is security, he will not proceed with the negotiations on political issues. That's it, \"Bar-Illan said. Police with dogs stood at every intersection along Tel Aviv's fashionable Dizengoff street, closed to traffic for the Purim holiday which has been marred by tragedies etched in Israeli minds over the last few years. Palestinians, shrugging off Bar-Illan's threat, said negotiations were already at a deadlock anyway and blamed the lack of security on Netanyahu's groundbreaking last week for the Jewish settlement at Jabal Abu Ghneim, or Har Homa. Israeli and PLO security services, partners to self-rule accords launched in 1993, stayed in contact and Israel's Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani met Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian Preventive Security chief in the West Bank. On a visit to Pakistan, Arafat criticised Israel for its plan to go on building in East Jerusalem. Rajoub said Israeli settlements, land confiscations and restrictions on Palestinians had to be stopped. \"It is the responsibility of the international community to exert pressure on the Israelis to stop such stupid policies, \"Rajoub told Reuters. In Damascus, an official Syrian daily said Netanyahu's policies had caused Friday's bomb attack. Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been severed for a year. Fierce Israeli-Arab clashes flared in Hebron on Saturday for a second straight day. Hospital officials said at least 20 Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds.", "title": "ISRAEL : Israel tightens security, may limit peace talks.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
