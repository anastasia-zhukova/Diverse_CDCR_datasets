Colleen Siegel JERUSALEM 1997-03-24 Israeli-PLO relations have hit a new low with the Palestinian Authority saying Israel is wrong to think it can treat the Authority like a client militia. Israel-Authority contacts, already battered by Israel's building a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, have reached the brink of breaking over an Islamist suicide bombing at a Tel Aviv cafe on Friday that killed three Israeli women. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the Authority has given a green light to attacks against Israel by militants opposed to the peace process. The Authority denies the charge. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Sunday there was a \"perception \"of a green light but no evidence. She said the Authority could do more to fight violence. Authority negotiator Saeb Erekat told CNN cable television on Sunday \"media lord \"Netanyahu was killing the peace process and spurring militants with settlement building. \"I think if there is one person who would look in the mirror tonight and see the blood $... if Mr Netanyahu would look in the mirror, he will see the real responsibility, \"Erekat said. A select forum of Israeli government ministers headed by Netanyahu stopped short on Sunday of officially severing talks with the Authority over the attack but demanded as a \"necessary step \"that it act against militants. Palestinian officials said Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Palestinian Culture Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo would meet on Monday in an effort \"to calm down the situation \"but Israel Radio said it was not clear if the meeting would take place. Israel's military intelligence chief Major General Moshe Yaalon told reporters the Authority had made a change in the political situation a condition for cooperation in fighting \"terror \". He also said clashes at week's end between Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops near Palestinian-ruled West Bank enclaves could have been ended sooner by the Authority and that they had been encouraged by one of its security officials. Asked to react to Israel's charge Palestinians were linking security cooperation to a political change, Ahmed Abd al-Rahman, secretary general of the Authority's cabinet, told Reuters : \"The security coordination is linked to the development of the political peace process and they are not separate. \"Referring to man who heads Israel's client South Lebanon Army militia in Israel's Lebanon occupation zone, Rahman added : \"They are wrong if they think that the Palestinian Authority is a copy of Antoine Lahd's forces in south Lebanon. \"After suicide attacks a year ago that killed 59 people in Israel, the Authority, created by the historic 1993 Israel-PLO framework peace deal and in charge of Gaza and West Bank areas handed over by Israel, arrested nearly 1,000 Islamists. On Sunday, a Palestinian official said there were no orders for mass arrests despite Israel's demand for a crackdown on groups including Hamas, which a caller to Israeli police said was responsible for Friday's bombing. The Israeli ministers demanded the Authority increase security cooperation ; prevent incitement against Israel ; fight militant groups ; arrest, try and punish \"terrorists \"; deal with Israel's extradition requests ; and confiscate illegal weapons. Netanyahu told CNN cable television after the meeting that he was not suspending talks with the Palestinians but that insistence they fight militants would be the top agenda item. Asked if his settlement policy, which Washington has criticised as creating mistrust, was not isolating Israel internationally, Netanyahu, elected last May, scoffed. \"This automatic, reflexive Israel bashing when we are getting thrown terrorist bombs I think is, frankly, quite sad, and I think history will judge it unkindly, \"he said.", "title": "ISRAEL : Israel-PLO relations hit new low.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
