Yuri Kushko DUSHANBE 1997-02-17 Islamic rebels in Tajikistan on Monday freed five U.N. workers, the last remaining captives in a two-week hostage crisis in the volatile former Soviet republic. A Tajik government official said that President Imomali Rakhmonov, who had personally negotiated the release of the five, greeted them at the village of Obigarm, some 80 km (50 miles) to the east of the capital Dushanbe. All the freed hostages $-- two U.N. military observers and three workers with the U.N. refugee agency $-- were on their way to Dushanbe, the official told Reuters in the Tajik capital. Rakhmonov who travelled to Obigarm to meet the rebels, said the talks had been aimed at reaching a final and peaceful solution to the standoff, which had dimmed hopes for peace in Tajikistan after a four-year civil war. \"No additional conditions have been set, \"he said. Neither the presidential side nor the rebels gave details of what agreements, if any, had been reached during the meeting. The crisis began on February 4 when a rebel group led by Bakhrom Sadirov seized the first of 15 hostages and demanded that the government allow Bakhrom's brother Rizvon and some 40 supporters to join him from neighbouring Afghanistan. After several days of fruitless negotiations, Russia, which views Tajikistan as a barrier against the spread of Islamic fundamentalism, stepped in with top level demands to use all necessary means to free the hostages. A Russian-led force of about 20,000 border guards and military peacekeepers are stationed in Tajikstan, a rugged, mountainous republic of 5.7 million rocked by clan rivalries. The Tajik authorities allowed more than 30 armed fighters to reach Sadirov's base on Saturday on the understanding that he would then free all his captives. But six were not released. Rakhmonov, clearly under heavy pressure from Moscow to settle the crisis, flew to Obigarm on Monday morning to negotiate directly with the hostage takers. The rebels arrived at Obigarm three hours late, bringing Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukhurov, who was captured during earlier negotiations. Zukhurov was then freed to join the talks on the remaining hostages : two U.N. observers $-- a Swiss and a Ukrainian $-- and three representatives of the U.N. refugee agency. Western observers estimate Rakhmonov only controls about 15 to 20 percent of the republic, with around half in the hands of the Islamist guerrillas, who have for years operated out of bases in neighbouring Afghanistan. The kidnappings raised fears that Tajikistan could explode into Afghan-style chaos, blowing apart a fragile peace clinched in December between the mainstream Islamic opposition and the government. Opposition leaders condemned the hostage-taking, which appeared to be part of an attempt by Sadirov, who once fought with the opposition, to set himself up as a third force. The Tajik president said on Monday it had done immeasurable harm. \"It is hard to recall a similar incident which would deal our country such a strong moral and material blow, \"he said. In a sign of the seriousness of the crisis, he took his deputy prime minister, the defence minister and his deputy and other officials to meet the rebels. The rebel leader, who had suggested the direct talks with Rakhmonov, gave assurances on Sunday that the hostages would not be harmed, but the two Tajik sides have little trust in each other. Last week the rebels said one of the U.N. observers had been shot, but the report turned out to be a bluff. It was only the intervention of Russia which led to negotiations resulting in earlier releases of some hostages.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : Tajik hostage crisis ends as U.N. workers freed.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
