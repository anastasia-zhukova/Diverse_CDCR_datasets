Yuri Kushko DUSHANBE 1997-02-09 Tajikistan's president held talks to resolve the country's hostage crisis on Sunday but a senior official in the mountainous former Soviet republic said there was no deal to free the 15 captives yet. \"No hostages will be released today, \"said the official, who asked not to be named. Presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov, speaking after talks between President Imomali Rakhmonov and a warlord controlling parts of northern Afghanistan, said progress had been made. These parts of Afghanistan provide a refuge for Tajikistan's Islamic opposition. \"The results of Mr Rakhmonov's talks inspire confidence in a fast and peaceful solution to the hostage problem, \"Saidov said. He said further discussions would be held on Monday, led by Deputy Prime Minister Abdurakhmon Nazimov. The hostage crisis began on Tuesday when a group of Islamic opposition rebels seized four United Nations military observers $-- an Austrian, a Ukrainian and two Swiss nationals. The rebels later captured four Russian reporters and their driver and four workers with the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukharov, who flew in to negotiate with the hostage-takers, was seized early on Saturday. The captors belong to a group loyal to Rizvon Sadirov, who once fought for Tajikistan's armed Islamic opposition but whose loyalties are now unclear. They are led by Rizvon's brother Bakhrom Sadirov, and are demanding free passage for colleagues based in neighbouring Afghanistan to return to Tajikistan. A United Nations representative had said he hoped the hostages could be freed on Sunday after the Tajik government promised to send helicopters to Afghanistan, pick up 40 rebels and bring them to Bakhrom Sadirov's base. But hopes of a quick end to the crisis have been dashed in the past. The Tajik authorities have issued daily statements saying that the hostages would be released but a helicopter sent on Friday to collect them returned empty. The crisis has marred celebrations to mark the end of the Ramadan month of fasting in the Moslem former Soviet republic. Russia's Interfax news agency, whose Dushanbe correspondent is among the captives, appealed to Sadirov to release them. \"We appeal to you as a military man and as a Moslem, on the occasion of the Ramadan holiday, to release the U.N. officials and the Russian journalists, first and foremost the women, who you are holding, \"the agency's appeal said. The captives are being held near the town of Obirgam which is in a mountaneous area some 80 km (50 miles) east of Dushanbe. International humaniatarian organisations are already pulling out of Tajikistan due to the kidnappings. The International Committee for the Red Cross said on Thursday it was suspending operations in the Central Asian state, and non-essential U.N. personnel began leaving the republic on Saturday.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : President tries to free Tajik captives, no deal yet.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
