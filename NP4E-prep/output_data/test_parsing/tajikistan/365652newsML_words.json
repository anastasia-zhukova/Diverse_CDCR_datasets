DUSHANBE 1997-02-09 Tajik rebels holding 15 hostages, including United Nations employees, Russian journalists and the country's security minister, may release them on Sunday under a deal struck with authorities, a U.N. official said. The official, a member of the U.N. Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT), told Reuters the government had promised to send several helicopters to neighbouring Afghanistan to pick up about 40 colleagues of the rebels and bring them safely to the hostage-takers' base. \"In line with the agreement, once the group of around 40 has arrived safely in Obirgam, the hostages will be released, \"said the official. The hostages were seized last week and are being held near the town of Obirgam which is in a mountainous area some 80 km (50 miles) east of the Tajik capital Dushanbe. The captives are four employees of the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR), including a Nigerian, four U.N. military observers from Austria, Switzerland and Ukraine, four Russian reporters, Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukhurov, a Tajik driver and an interpreter. The hostage-takers are part of a group led by Rizvon Sadirov, who once fought for the country's armed Islamic opposition but whose loyalties are now unclear. They have been demanding free passage for fellow rebels based in neighbouring Afghanistan to return to Tajikistan. Tajikistan, a mountainous country bordering China, has been racked by a four-year civil war but a ceasefire between the government and Islamic opposition forces last December appears to be holding.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : Tajik rebels may free hostages on Sunday $- U.N..", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
