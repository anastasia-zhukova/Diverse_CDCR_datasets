DUSHANBE 1997-02-14 Islamic fighters holding more than a dozen Russian and Western hostages, one of whom they say they have killed, gave the Tajik government until 1000 GMT on Friday to meet their demands, a presidential spokesman said. Zafar Saidov told Reuters that the hostage takers had threatened to take their captives to the mountains and launch a guerrilla war against the government if their demand $-- a swap of the hostages for a group of their supporters $-- were not met. The Tajik government had flown 35 supporters of the hostage-takers into Tajikistan from Afghanistan on Thursday. The fighters are led by brothers Bakhram and Rizvon Sadirov. The brothers want to swap all the hostages for all the fighters and say their supporters must be armed. The government is ready to accept most demands but sticking points appear to be the venue of the swap and the arming of the Sadirovs' fighters. The hostage crisis started early last week. The Sadirovs are holding three U.N. observers $-- two Swiss and a Ukrainian $-- along with four Russian journalists, four staff of the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR and the Tajik security minister, who was seized when he arrived to negotiate. Bakhram Sadirov told the U.N. mission in the Tajik capital Dushanbe on Friday that his group had shot dead one of the U.N. military observers, but there has been no independent confirmation. \"Yesterday night Bakhram Sadirov contacted us and confirmed that his people had shot dead a military observer, \"a U.N. mission source told Reuters in the Tajik capital. The source declined to be named or to make further comment. The Russian journalists held were the first to report the death of a fellow-hostage on Thursday, but it is unclear whether reports they have sent from captivity simply reflect what their captors want them to say. Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin spoke to Tajik President Imomali Rakhomov on Friday morning about the crisis, Itar-Tass news agency said without giving details. Rakhmonov has said he is prepared to meet the demands of the hostage takers. Chernomyrdin said after a late-night government meeting on Thursday that Russia would take all necessary means to save the lives of Russian and Western hostages in Tajikistan, and added he hoped they would be released by Friday morning. Russian President Boris Yeltsin, recovering from pneumonia at a country residence, expressed his growing concern over the crisis and asked to be kept fully informed, Tass said. Yeltsin also urged Rakhmonov to do everything possible to free the hostages.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : Tajik hostage takers issue 1000 GMT ultimatum.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
