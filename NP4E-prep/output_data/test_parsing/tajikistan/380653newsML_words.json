Yuri Kushko DUSHANBE 1996-02-16 The fate of 11 Western and Russian hostages held by Islamic rebels in Tajikistan's snowy mountains apparently hung in the balance after their captors failed to release them under a Russian-mediated deal. The main rebel demand was met when the Tajik government allowed 35 armed supporters to join the rogue group led by brothers Rizvon and Bakhrom Sadirov. But Tajik presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov said : \"Bakhrom Sadirov has not released the hostages. Their fate is unknown because from 4.30 p.m. (1130 GMT on Saturday) all communications with their base have been down and all attempts to restore them have failed. \"Gennady Sizov, a Russian diplomat mediating in the crisis, told Russian Television : \"A very strong doubt appears $... that they will return the hostages. They have simply deceived the whole world community. \"Asked whether he knew about the condition of the hostages, Sizov said : \"They are in a very, very bad shape. They are humiliated, morally and physically. They have been tied. \"The hostages include three U.N. observers $-- two from Switzerland and one from Ukraine $-- four workers with the U.N. refugee agency, two Russian television journalists and Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukhurov. Zukhurov was seized last weekend when he arrived to try to negotiate the release of the hostages captured earlier in the former Soviet republic. Under the deal mediated by Russian officials, 35 of Sadirov's supporters were flown in from Afghanistan and allowed to go to his Kalainav mountain base in a rocky region 80 km (50 miles) from the Tajik capital Dushanbe. The rebels were then expected to set their hostages free and let them walk about one mile (km) down the mountain to the village of Obigarm, where Russian and Tajik government negotiators were waiting. Instead, the rebels apparently switched off their communications and their intentions remained unclear. Media reports said the Tajik government concentrated a considerable military force near Obigarm and the rebels might be waiting for darkness to try to flee, possibly leaving the hostages behind. The crisis highlighted the instability of Tajikistan, an impoverished mountainous state bordering Afghanistan and China. President Imomali Rakhmonov and the leader of the united Islamist opposition, Sayid Abdullo Nuri, agreed on a ceasefire in December after a four-year civil war in which tens of thousands of people were killed. The ceasefire seems to be holding, but rogue armed groups opposed to Rakhmonov are still scattered across the country and some, like those loyal to the Sadirovs, are based in Afghanistan. Rizvon Sadirov, a key military commander for the Islamic opposition during the civil war, later switched to Rakhmonov's side and now appears to be trying to form a third force of his own.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : Fate of hostages in balance in Tajikistan.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
