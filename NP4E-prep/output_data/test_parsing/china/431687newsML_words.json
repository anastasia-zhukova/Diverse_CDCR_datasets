TAIPEI 1997-03-10 A Taiwan journalist doused himself with gasoline on Monday and forced a Taiwan airliner to fly to the communist Chinese mainland, authorities said. Far East Air Transport flight 128, a Boeing 757, had just taken off from southern Kaohsiung with 150 passengers and six or seven crew at 0603 GMT when the hijacking took place, authorities said. The plane, flying a route to the Taiwan capital Taipei, landed safely at China's southeastern coastal port of Xiamen less than two hours later, mainland aviation officials said. There were no reports of injuries. Authorities had no immediate explanation as to the hijacker's motive. Even before the plane landed at Xiamen, Taiwan authorities identified the suspect as Liu Shan-chung, a journalist who worked briefly for the east Taiwan newspaper Lientung Daily after being fired a year ago from Kaohsiung's The Commons Daily for discipline problems. \"He was fired last summer after his alcoholism caused erratic behaviour, \"Commons Daily editor Yao Chih-hai told Reuters by telephone from its head office in Kaohsiung. Taiwan aviation sources said the hijacker doused himself with gasoline and ordered the pilot to fly to the Fujian province port of Xiamen. Taiwan Defence Minister Chiang Chung-ling said four Taiwan fighters had scrambled into an escort formation and tailed the plane part of the way across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan defence officials decided not to intercept the flight so as not to incite a military \"misunderstanding \"with arch rival China's People's Liberation Army, a defence official told Reuters.", "title": "TAIWAN : Taiwan newsman hijacks plane to rival China.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
