TAIPEI 1997-03-10 An passenger aircraft operated by Taiwan's Far Eastern Air Lines was hijacked on Monday and was flying in the direction of the Chinese mainland, Taiwan aviation sources and state media said. Far Eastern flight 128, a Boeing 757 with a capacity of 201 passengers, had departed from Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung on a scheduled route to Taipei when it changed course and headed toward China's communist mainland. It was not immediately known how many passengers and crew were aboard. Aviation sources contacted by Reuters said a lone hijacker, said to be a journalist, doused himself with gasoline and ordered the pilot to fly to the Fujian province port of Xiamen. The aircraft was circling in mainland Chinese airspace awaiting permission from Chinese authorities to land. Taiwan defence minister Chiang Chung-ling confirmed to parliament in an emergency briefing that the hijacker had brandished a flammable liquid and ordered the plane to China, and said four Taiwan fighters had scrambled to into an escort formation. Taiwan defence officials took a decision not to intercept the flight so as not to incite a military \"misunderstanding \"with arch rival China's People's Liberation Army, a defence official who told Reuters by telephone.", "title": "TAIWAN : Taiwan aircraft hijacked to China $- sources.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
