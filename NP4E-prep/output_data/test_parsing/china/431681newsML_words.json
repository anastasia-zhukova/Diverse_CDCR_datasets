BEIJING 1997-03-10 A jobless Taiwan journalist who hijacked a Taiwanese airliner to China on Monday has requested political asylum, officials said. The suspected hijacker, identified by Taiwan as Liu Shan-chung, had been taken into custody and questioned by Chinese police, officials said. Liu had doused himself with gasoline and forced a Boeing 757 operated by Taiwan's Far East Air Transport to fly to China, Taiwanese authorities said. The plane, carrying 150 passengers and six crew, landed safely at an airport in the southeastern city of Xiamen less than two hours later, Chinese officials said. No injuries were reported. \"The hijacker wants political asylum, \"an airport official said by telephone from Xiamen. The official said it was not yet known what China's response would be. In Taipei, Lee Yun-ning, general manager of Far East Air Transport, told reporters : \"The hijacker told the captain,' I am a victim of political repression', \"in Taiwan. The Taiwan airliner was on a scheduled flight from the island's southern city of Kaohsiung to Taipei when it changed course and headed for China. Liu, a journalist, worked briefly for the east Taiwan newspaper Lientung Daily after being fired a year ago from Kaohsiung's The Commons Daily for discipline problems, his former employers said. In Taiwan, Defence Minister Chiang Chung-ling said four Taiwan fighters had scrambled and tailed the plane part of the way across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan defence officials decided not to intercept the flight to avoid a military \"misunderstanding \"with arch rival China's People's Liberation Army, a defence official told Reuters. The last hijacking of a Taiwan airliner to China was in May 1986, when the pilot of a Boeing 747 cargo plane owned by Taiwan's flag carrier China Airlines commandeered the jet and flew it to Guangzhou in south China. Beijing returned the plane and two crew members, who did not want to stay in China after talks between the two rivals in Hong Kong. Taiwan has banned direct air links with China since 1949, when the communists defeated the Nationalists and drove them into exile on the island. China endured a rash of 12 hijackings in 1993 and 1994 by Chinese who ordered pilots to fly them to the Nationalist-ruled Taiwan for political asylum. Air piracy fell off sharply after Beijing launched a drive to improve what had been lax security at most airports.", "title": "CHINA : Taiwan hijacker seeks asylum in China.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
