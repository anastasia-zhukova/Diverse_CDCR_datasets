Lawrence Chung TAIPEI 1997-03-10 The pilot of a Taiwan civilian aircraft hijacked to China on Monday disobeyed an order from Beijing to fly directly home to ensure he did not stray from established flight corridors and avoid the risk of being shot down by Taipei's air defences. Instead, pilot Yeh Teh-yung took the Far East Air Transport Boeing 757 on a dog-leg pattern, flying initially southeastward into Hong Kong's air traffic control zone before turning northeastward toward Taipei. \"They demanded we take a direct flight from Shantou, but our company has its own flight plan so we flew toward another point before flying toward our island (Taiwan), \"Yeh told Reuters after piloting the plane back to Taipei. By insisting on flying the indirect route back from the mainland airport at Xiamen, Yeh refused a demand by mainland air traffic control officials to fly a bee-line from Shantou, just southwest of Xiamen, back to Taipei. Yeh said the course took the jet briefly into Hong Kong's air traffic region and he had radio contact with Hong Kong. Far East Flight 128 had just taken off for Taipei from Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung when a man drenched in gasoline threatened to set himself ablaze unless Yeh flew the plane to Xiamen on China's southeastern coast. Airline general manager Lee Yun-ning said it would have been suicide to fly the route demanded by Beijing. \"If we were to fly directly over the midline of the Taiwan strait, the Taiwan air force would have scrambled fighters to shoot it down, \"Lee said. The Taiwan strait is one of the most fortified frontiers in the world, where for 48 years China's three-million strong People's Liberation Army has faced off against Taiwan's smaller but far better equipped army. Since a civil war split them in 1949, Beijing has regarded Nationalist-ruled Taiwan as a renegade province that must be brought under mainland sovereignty, by force if necessary. Taiwan has resisted by banning all official contacts with the mainland authorities. Taiwan media interpreted Beijing's insistence on a direct route back to Taipei without a detour to Hong Kong or Macau as a bid by the communist authorities in Beijing to establish a direct-flight precedent that would undermine the ban.", "title": "TAIWAN : Hijack pilot ignored Beijing order over return route.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
