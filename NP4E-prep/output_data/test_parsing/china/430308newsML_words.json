Taiwan plane said skipping \"third place \"detour. TAIPEI 1997-03-10 A Taiwan airliner hijacked to China on Monday was returning directly to Taiwan rather than detouring through Hong Kong or another \"third place \", a striking break with past practice, executives said. \"The aircraft will fly out of Xiamen and Shantou, overfly the midpoint of the Taiwan strait and then fly directly into Taipei, \"said Lee Chung-ning, general manager of Far East Air Transport whose Boeing 757 was hijacked earlier in the day. Lee said skipping a detour through Hong Kong or Macau was suggested by China's government in the interest of convenience. \"It was requested by the air traffic controllers in Xiamen that the plane fly directly to Taiwan, \"Lee said. In the 12 previous instances of mainland aircraft being hijacked to Taiwan, those aircraft were obliged by Taipei to return to China by way of the air space of a \"third place \", always Hong Kong or Macau, so as to preserve Taiwan's decades-old ban on direct flights across the Taiwan strait. Taiwan media interpreted the direct return on Monday of Far East Air Transport's Boeing 757 as a bid by the communist authorities in Beijing to establish a direct-flight precedent that would undermine the ban. Since a civil war split them in 1949, Beijing has regarded Nationalist-ruled Taiwan as a renegade province that must be brought under mainland sovereignty. Taiwan has resisted by banning all official contacts with the mainland authorities.", "title": "TAIWAN : Taiwan plane said skipping \"", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
