Jeffrey Parker TAIPEI 1997-03-10 A jobless journalist on Monday doused himself with petrol in a Taiwan airliner and hijacked it to China, where he complained of political repression by Taiwan and requested asylum, officials said. The latest of 13 Taiwan Strait hijackings in the 1990s was novel in that it was the first in which a plane was forced to fly to the communist Chinese mainland rather than away from it. The Far East Air Transport Boeing 757 had just left southern Kaohsiung bound for Taipei with 150 passengers and eight crew when a man drenched in gasoline threatened to immolate himself unless the pilot flew to China, officials and witnesses said. Suspect Liu Shan-chung, 45, was arrested moments after the plane touched down at China's southeastern port of Xiamen. Air piracy is a capital offence on the Chinese mainland. \"I am a victim of political repression, \"the unemployed journalist said during the confrontation with the flight crew, according to chief flight attendant Kao Yung-chen. \"I 've faced discrimination because I am a mainlander on Taiwan, \"said Liu, who was born in China's Henan province and had a history of friction with co-workers as an adult in Taiwan. Kao said Liu appeared calm and clear-minded, although he wept at times, saying it took him three days to decide on the action to call attention to his own plight. Taiwan swiftly demanded Liu's extradition. \"We have legal jurisdiction, \"Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao said even before the plane had returned. \"The mainland authorities should return the hijacker immediately. \"Passengers' papers were checked by Chinese officials but the plane was allowed to depart for Taipei after just two hours. \"The mainland authorities' handling of the affair was highly commendable, \"said Taiwan civil aviation chief Tsai Tui. Taiwan defence officials said four fighters had scrambled into an escort formation and tailed the plane part of the way across the Taiwan Strait but pulled away to avoid a military \"misunderstanding \"with China's People's Liberation Army. It was not immediately known how China's air force reacted. There was confusion over the plane's route back to Taiwan, a sensitive political issue in view of Taiwan's decades-old ban on direct flights and other direct contacts with communist China. Airline president Lee Chung-ning said the pilot, at China's request, had flown directly to Taipei rather than detouring via Hong Kong or Macau air space $-- skipping a practice that Taipei had insisted on after previous hijackings to enforce its ban. Civil aviation chief Tsai disagreed, saying the plane had come under Hong Kong air traffic control even if it did not overfly the British territory. Pilot Yeh Teh-yung said Beijing had ordered the jet to fly directly to Taipei but that he had taken it briefly into Hong Kong's air traffic control zone. The hijacking could pose new headaches for both sides. China, should it fete the hijacker as a legitimate refugee from an oppressive Taiwan, could risk being seen as endorsing political violence just days after terrorist bombings blamed on Moslem separatists hit its far western Xinjiang region and a smaller bus bombing in Beijing itself. China and Taiwan have been rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 when the Nationalists fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the communists. In the only other known incident of a Taiwan plane flying to China, a Taiwan captain was hailed as a hero in 1986 after piloting a Taiwan cargo plane to Guangzhou and defecting. For Taiwan's exiled Nationalist government, the hijacking could increase pressure to end the ban on direct cross-strait flights by establishing a direct-flight precedent. It also could rekindle simmering frictions between the island's local Taiwanese majority and Chinese mainlanders who until only recently controlled Taiwan political life.", "title": "TAIWAN : Taiwan-China hijacking reverses longtime pattern.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
