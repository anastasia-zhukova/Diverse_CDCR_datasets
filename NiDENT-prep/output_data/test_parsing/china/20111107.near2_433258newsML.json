Kevin Chen TAIPEI 1997-03-11 Taiwan urged China on Tuesday to return the man detained for hijacking a Taiwanese airliner to the mainland but conceded Beijing was unlikely to comply. The quasi-official agency responsible for dealings with China said a lack of a formal agreement on repatriation of hijackers would likely prevent unemployed newsman Liu Shan-chung from being returned for trial. \"_ In the past, we had reached some understanding (on hijackers _' repatriation), _\"Chang Liang-jen, vice-secretary general of the Straits Exchange Foundation, told reporters. \"_ But since the understanding did not materalise into a written agreement, the affair probably will not be handled according_to what for us is a deal, _\" he said. Taiwan and China, rivals since splitting after a civil war in 1949, reached a semi-official accord in January 1995 on repatriating hijackers, but subsequent political tensions thwarted the deal's signing. Liu, who doused himself with gasoline and forced a Far East Air Transport domestic plane to fly to China's southeastern port of Xiamen on Monday, remained in the custody of Chinese police. Beijing returned the Boeing 757 and its 158 passengers and crew to Taipei on Monday night but has not said whether it would deport Liu, who cited political repression in Taiwan and has asked for asylum in China. Senior Chinese officials said on Tuesday that China considered Liu a hijacker and not a defector. Taiwan's government has given high marks to Chinese authorities for handling the hijacking, but expressed the hope that Liu would be returned. \"_ I hope the Chinese communists, after completing an initial interrogation, will send Liu Shan-tung back to our side for legal handling, _\"Taiwan government spokesman Su Chi was quoted by state-run Central News Agency as saying. Analysts said Taiwan's case was weakened by its own refusal to repatriate 16 hijackers from mainland China. Most were arrested in a string of 12 hijackings in 1993 and 1994. China indefinitely suspended semi-official talks, including negotiations on hijacker repatriation, with Taiwan in mid-1995 in a dispute over senior Taiwan leaders' overseas travel. China apparently dropped its cold-war practice of hailing Taiwan air pirates as heroes. \"_ Of course he is a hijacker, _\" mainland civil aviation chief Chen Guanyi told reporters. \"_ He was soaked in gasoline and holding a lighter, endangering the safety of passengers. _\"In 1986, just before the ideological showdown began to ebb, Beijing gave a hero's welcome to a Taiwan pilot who defected to China by flying a cargo plane to southern Guangzhou.", "title": "TAIWAN : Taiwan says hijacker unlikely to return from China.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
