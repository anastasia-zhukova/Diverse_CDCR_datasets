Benjamin Kang Lim BEIJING 1997-03-11 Chinese authorities said on Tuesday a jobless Taiwanese journalist who commandeered a Taiwan airliner to China was considered a hijacker and not a defector. Chinese officials were tightlipped whether Liu Shan-chung, 45, who is in custody in China's southeastern city of Xiamen, would be prosecuted or repatriated to Taiwan. \"_ Of course he is a hijacker, _\"Chen Guangyi, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told reporters when asked if Liu was a defector or a hijacker. \"_ He was soaked in gasoline and holding a lighter, endangering the safety of passengers, _\"Chen said before the start of a session of the National People's Congress, or parliament. If China treats Liu as a defector, it risks being seen as endorsing political violence after a string of bombings blamed on Moslem separatists in its far western region of Xinjiang and a bomb that exploded on a bus in the capital Beijing. Asked if Liu would be repatriated, Chen said authorities would deal with the case \"_ appropriately _\" . He did not elaborate. \"_ We are opposed to hijacking, _\"He Guoqiang, the acting governor of Fujian province where Xiamen is located, told reporters at the parliament session. The hijacker on Monday doused himself with petrol on board a Boeing 757 operated by Taiwan's Far East Air Transport and hijacked the plane to Xiamen, complaining of political repression at home and requesting political asylum. Taiwan has demanded China return the suspect, saying it had the right to put him on trial. In Taipei, the United Daily News, a leading newspaper, said in an editorial : \"_ If communist China does not want to return the hijacker it should impose appropriate penalties according_to law. _\"Air piracy is a capital offence in China. Asked if the hijacker might be sentenced to death, China's Public Security Minister, Tao Siju, said : \"_ It_'s up_to the courts. \"_ We have a strict judicial process and regulations, _\"Tao told reporters. \"_ It will be determined through the judicial process step_by_step. _\"The hijacked airliner, carrying 150 passengers and eight crew, was on a scheduled flight from Taiwan's southern city of Kaohsiung to Taipei when it was forced to head for China. The plane and all passengers and crew $-- except_for Liu $-- returned to Taiwan safely about three hours after landing in Xiamen. The suspected hijacker worked briefly as a journalist for the Lientung Daily in eastern Taiwan after being fired a year ago from Kaohsiung's The Commons Daily for disciplinary problems, his former employers said. The incident was the latest of 13 hijackings across the Taiwan Strait in the 1990s. Air piracy fell off sharply after Beijing launched a drive to improve what had been lax security at most airports. In the only other known incident of a Taiwan civilian plane flying to China, the pilot of a Boeing 747 cargo plane operated by Taiwan's flag carrier China Airlines was hailed as a hero in China after flying his aircraft to the southern city of Guangzhou in May 1986 and defecting. Taiwan has banned direct air links with China since 1949 when the communists won the Chinese civil war and drove the defeated Nationalists into exile on the island.", "title": "CHINA : China says Taiwan hijacker not defector.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
