UNITED NATIONS 1997-02-07 The Security Council condemned on Friday the kidnapping of more than a dozen international personnel in Tajikistan and demanded the immediate release of all those taken hostage. A statement read at a brief public meeting stressed the \"_ inadmissibility of kidnapping and any other mistreatment of United Nations personnel. _\" \"_ The Security Council strongly condemns the attacks on and kidnapping of international personnel, _\" it said, referring particularly to U.N. military observers and staff of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The statement was issued after a spate of hostage-taking this week by a breakaway Tajik rebel faction that seized members of all those organisations as_well_as several Russian reporters. The United Nations announced on Friday in Dushanbe, the Tajik capital, that it was withdrawing all non-essential staff from the former Soviet republic, where a ceasefire last December largely halted a four-year civil war between the secular government and an armed Islamic opposition. The Red Cross also announced it was suspending operations in Tajikistan after two of its staff were abducted. The two, a British woman and her Tajik translator, were later released. However, the kidnappers were still holding four employees of the UNHCR, including a Nigerian ; four U.N. military observers, including two from Switzerland and one each from Austria and Ukraine ; and four Russian reporters. About 45 U.N. observers have been stationed in Tajikistan while Russia maintains a peackeeping force of about 20,000. The peacekeeping force also guards the border with Afghanistan, where many of the rebels are based. The hostage-takers are part of a group commanded by Rizvon Sadirov, who once fought for the Islamic opposition but whose loyalties are now unclear. The kidnappings were carried out by Sadirov's brother, Bakhrom Sadirov, who was demanding free passage back to Tajikistan for other members based in neighbouring Afghanistan. The Security Council statement welcomed the signing by the parties of an agreement in Moscow last December and welcomed progress made in inter-Tajik talks held in Tehran. \"_ It believes that these agreements, provided they are carried out as written, represent a qualitative change for the better and give a new impetus to efforts aimed at achieving national reconciliation, _\" the council said. It called for progress in future rounds of talks while noting with satisfaction that the ceasefire had generally been observed since December. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was asked to keep the situation under review and to submit recommendations regarding the U.N. presence in Tajikistan in the light of progress made in implementing the agreements. The council also expressed deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation and called for continuing emergency relief.", "title": "UNITED NATIONS : U.N. council condemns hostage-taking in Tajikistan.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
