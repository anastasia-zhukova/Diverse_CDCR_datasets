Yuri Kushko DUSHANBE 1997-02-16 Islamic rebels holding Russian and Western hostages in a remote mountain stronghold in Tajikistan freed five of their captives on Sunday but kept the last six, whose fate will be negotiated on Monday. Zafar Saidov, spokesman for the Tajik president, confirmed that the released hostages had reached the government checkpoint at the village of Obigarm, some 80 km (50 miles) to the east of the capital Dushanbe. They were a Swiss military observer working with the United Nations, two Russian television reporters, a Tajik interpreter and an employee of the U.N. refugee agency. Saidov also said that Tajik President Imomali Rakmonov would fly to Obigarm on Monday morning and start talks with the hostage-takers led by brothers Bakhrom and Rizvon Sadirov over the release of the last six hostages. \"_ Bakhrom said he was ready to negotiate directly with the president and the president readily accepted the proposal, _\"Saidov said earlier on Sunday. Sadirov gave assurances that none of the hostages would be harmed, Saidov said. \"_ Do_ n't worry about the hostages. Nothing threatens their lives, _\" he quoted Bakhrom Sadirov as saying. The rebels are holding two other U.N. military observers $-- a Swiss and a Ukrainian $-- three workers of the U.N. refugee agency and Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukhurov. On Saturday the Tajik authorities, backed by Moscow, handed over more than 30 armed fighters to Sadirov on the understanding that he would in return release all his captives. But the rebels, based at their Kalainav stronghold on top of a mountain about one mile (km) above Obigarm in a remote region of the former Soviet republic, failed to free the hostages and temporarily broke off walkie-talkie negotiations. They resumed contact early on Sunday with mediator Gennady Sizov, a Russian diplomat based in Tajikistan. Several senior Russian officials, including Deputy Prime Minsiter Vitaly Ignatenko, also maintained direct telephone contact with Bakhrom Sadirov and appeared increasingly frustrated over his stance. Saidov said Security Minister Zukhurov, himself seized last weekend when he arrived to try to negotiate the release of the other hostages, was expected to join Monday's talks between Rakhmonov and Sadirov in Obigarm. The rebels have already freed four captives $-- an Austrian military observer, two Russian women journalists and a driver. The hostage crisis started on February 4, when a rogue group led by Bakhrom Sadirov seized hostages and demanded that the government allow free passage for his brother Rizvon and some 40 of his men to his base in Tajikistan from neighbouring Afghanistan. Rizvon joined his brother last weekend. The crisis has highlighted the instability of Tajikistan, an impoverished mountainous state bordering Afghanistan and China. President Rakhmonov and the leader of the united Islamist opposition, Sayid Abdullo Nuri, agreed on a ceasefire last December after a four-year civil war in which tens of thousands were killed and many more displaced. The ceasefire seems to be holding, but rogue groups opposed to Rakhmonov are still scattered across the country and some, like those loyal to the Sadirovs, are based in Afghanistan. Russia, which views Tajikistan as a barrier against the possible spread of Islamic fundamentalism, keeps a considerable military contingent there under an inter-government agreement and also helps police its border with Afghanistan.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : Islamic rebels free five hostages, keep last six.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
