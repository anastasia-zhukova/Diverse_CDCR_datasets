GENEVA 1997-02-06 The United Nations refugee agency on Thursday condemned the kidnapping of four of its staff and 12 others in Tajikistan, and called on the government to secure their immediate release. Sadako Ogata, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a statement that all the hostages had been taken to Obigarm, 80 km (50 miles) east of Dushanbe, \"_ a stronghold of an armed opposition group believed reponsible for the kidnappings _\". The UNHCR statement issued in Geneva said the 12 included five U.N. observers, two International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegates and five journalists kidnapped on Tuesday and on Wednesday. Its own four staff members were a Nigerian, a local security guard and two drivers. \"_ We deplore the kidnappings in the strongest possible terms, _\"said Ogata, who urged the Tajikistan government \"_ to do its utmost in securing the immediate release of the hostages _\". Officials from the U.N. observer mission in Tajikistan and the ICRC were meeting high-level officials in Tajikistan to discuss securing the hostages' release, it added. \"_ The abductions of the UNHCR workers today took place in broad daylight in Dushanbe during regular working hours. They were being transported out_of the city, past government checkpoints. The incident regrettably indicates the serious deterioration in the security situation for UNHCR and other international workers, _\"Ogata said.", "title": "SWITZERLAND : UN appeals for release of hostages in Tajikistan.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
