Yuri Kushko DUSHANBE 1997-02-15 The Tajik government said on Saturday it had handed over 26 guerrillas to a rebel Islamist group holding 11 Western and Russian hostages and said it now expected the swift release of the captives. \"_ At 1340 local time (0840 GMT) 26 freed rebels crossed the last checkpoint of government forces. Thus the government has met the demand of the hostage-takers and now expects the release of all hostages, _\"Zafar Saidov, spokesman to the Tajik president, told Reuters. Saidov said Russian diplomat Gennady Sizov and Tajik Deputy Prime Minister Abdurakhmon Azimov were supervising the hostage-for-fighter swap and were waiting at a government checkpoint for the return of 11 hostages. \"_ But so_far there is no news the hostages have been released, _\"Saidov said. The Tajik government earlier released seven fighters it had flown from neighbouring Afghanistan in line with the demands of the hostage-takers. Late on Friday the rebels freed three of their hostages $-- two Russian woman journalists and a driver. The hostages still held by the rebels include three U.N. observers $-- two from Switzerland and one from Ukraine $-- four workers with the U.N. refugee agency and the Tajik Security Minister abducted last weekend when he flew in to negotiate. Rebel leader Bakhrom Sadirov had demanded that the government allow safe passage for his brother Rizvon and some 40 of his men from Afghanistan to his mountain base in a rocky region about 80 km (50 miles) from the Tajik capital Dushanbe. A_few days ago Rizvon joined his brother at the base near the town of Obigarm, 80 km (50 miles) from the Tajik capital Dushanbe. On Friday the Tajik goverment flew in by helicopter more than 30 fighters from Afghanistan and seemed to have agreed to the rebels' other demands. Saidov said the 26 released fighters had taken with them 35 unloaded Kalashnikov submachine guns and also ammunition in sealed zinc boxes. The seven rebels released earlier had also been given arms, he added. The hostage crisis has highlighted the instability of Tajikistan, an impoverished mountaneous state bordering Afghanistan and China. President Imomali Rakhmonov and the leader of the country's united Islamist opposition Sayid Abdullo Nuri agreed on a ceasefire last December after a four-year civil war which left tens of thusands dead and many more displaced. The ceasefire seems to be holding, but armed groups opposed to the Tajik president are still scattered across the country. Some fighters, like those loyal to Sadirov and his brother Rizvon, are based in Afghanistan.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : Tajik government resumes rebels-for-hostages swap.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
