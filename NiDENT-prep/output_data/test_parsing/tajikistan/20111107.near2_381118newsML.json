Yuri Kushko DUSHANBE 1997-02-16 Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov agreed on Sunday to hold direct talks with Islamist rebels holding 11 Western and Russian hostages in a bid to end a long-running hostage crisis in the former Soviet republic. Presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov said Rakhmonov would travel to the village of Obigarm, 80 km (50 miles) east of the Tajik capital Dushanbe, to begin direct talks with rebel chief Bakhrom Sadirov at 9 a.m. (0400 GMT) on Monday. \"_ Bakhrom said he was ready to negotiate directly with the president and the president readily accepted the proposal, _\"Saidov told Reuters. Sadirov, who has refused offers of mediation from foreign countries, also announced he would release five of his captives later on Sunday, Saidov said. The rebels reassured the Tajik authorities that their hostages, who include Russian journalists, United Nations military observers and Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukhurov, would not be harmed, Saidov added. \"_ Do_ n't worry about the hostages. Nothing threatens their lives, _\" he quoted Bakhrom Sadirov as saying. On Saturday the Tajik authorities, backed by Moscow, handed over more than 30 fighters to Sadirov on the understanding that he would in return release his captives. But the rebels, based on top of a mountain near Obigarm in a remote rocky region of the former Soviet republic, failed to free the hostages and broke off walkie-talkie negotiations. They resumed contact early on Sunday with mediator Gennady Sizov, a Russian diplomat based in Tajikistan. Asked whether he knew about the condition of the hostages, Sizov told Russian Television : \"_ They are in a very, very bad shape. They are humiliated, morally and physically. They have been tied. _\"The rebels were also in telephone contact with Russian deputy prime minister Vitaly Ignatyenko in Moscow, who urged them to release the hostages without further delay. \"_ Be a man, fulfil the promises you made, release the hostages, do not play with human lives, _\"Itar-Tass news agency quoted Ignatyenko as telling Sadirov. Saidov told Reuters that Tajik Security Minister Zukhurov, still in captivity, was expected to join Monday's talks between Rakhmonov and Sadirov in Obigarm. Zukhurov was himself seized last weekend when he arrived to try to negotiate the release of the other hostages. The rebels have so_far freed four captives $-- an Austrian military observer, two Russian women journalists and a driver. The hostage crisis started on February 4, when a rogue group led by Bakhrom Sadirov seized hostages and demanded that the government allow free passage for his brother Rizvon and some 40 of his men to his base in Tajikistan from neighbouring Afghanistan. Rizvon joined his brother last weekend. The hostage crisis has highlighted the instability of Tajikistan, an impoverished mountainous state bordering Afghanistan and China. President Rakhmonov and the leader of the united Islamist opposition, Sayid Abdullo Nuri, agreed on a ceasefire last December after a four-year civil war in which tens of thousands were killed and many more displaced. The ceasefire seems to be holding, but rogue groups opposed to Rakhmonov are still scattered across the country and some, like those loyal to the Sadirovs, are based in Afghanistan. Rizvon Sadirov, a key military commander for the Islamic opposition during the civil war, later switched to Rakhmonov's side and now seems to be trying to form his own third force.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : Tajik president intervenes to end hostage crisis.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
