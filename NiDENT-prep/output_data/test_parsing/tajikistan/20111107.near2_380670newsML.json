Dmitry Solovyov ALMATY 1997-02-15 Tajikistan's united Islamic opposition has condemned the actions of a rebel group still holding 11 Western and Russian hostages and has demanded the immediate release of all the captives. \"_ We strongly condemn this new terrorist act of the (rebel) Sadirov brothers and think their escapade has harmed the honour of Tajiks and Tajikistan, _\" said the declaration of the opposition signed by its leader Sayid Abdullo Nuri. The declaration issued by the opposition's headquarters in the Iranian capital Tehran was faxed to Reuters in the Kazakh capital Almaty on Saturday. Late on Friday the rebels led by brothers Bakhrom and Rizvon Sadirov released three hostages $-- two Russian woman reporters from Itar-Tass and Interfax news agencies and a driver. The rebels are demanding to be reunited with 40 of their fellow-fighters from Afghanistan. The Tajik government, bowing to their wishes, flew in 35 fighters on Friday. Six have so_far been handed over to the rebels and negotiations are continuing. The Tajik opposition leaders in Tehran said they were concerned that the Sadirov brothers' act could hamper the broader peace process now underway in the war-shattered former Soviet republic. \"_ We consider this terrorist act as a provocation that could slow down the process of national reconciliation and demand the release of the hostages, _\" deputy opposition leader Khodzi Akbar Turadzhon Zoda told Reuters by phone from Tehran. \"_ The main thing is that Russian and other security services closely watching the situation in Tajikistan should not interfere or succumb to provocations, _\" he said. The hostages held by Sadirov's men also include three U.N. observers $-- two from Switzerland and one from Ukraine $-- and four workers with the U.N. refugee agency. Tajikistan's security minister was also seized last weekend when he tried to negotiate with the hostage-takers, who once backed the Islamic opposition but whose loyalties are now unclear. Tajikistan's hostage crisis, which started early last week, has highlighted the instability of Tajikistan, an impoverished mountainous state bordering Afghanistan and China. President Imomali Rakhmonov, backed by Moscow, has vowed to continue negotiations with the rebels. But the opposition has criticised his government for not taking measures to neutralise the Sadirov rebels after their previous hostage-taking act last December, when they captured seven U.N. military observers and two Tajik opposition members. \"_ At a Moscow meeting on December 23 1996, President Rakhmonov assured the leader of the united Tajik opposition that he would take decisive measures to liquidate this terrorist group, but he did not implement this, _\" the opposition's declaration said. During their Moscow meeting in December Rakhmonov and Nuri agreed on a ceasefire and pledged to cooperate to rebuild the country's shattered economy after a four-year civil war that has left tens of thousands dead and many more displaced. The ceasefire seems to be holding but armed groups opposed to the Tajik president are still scattered across the country. Some fighters, such as those loyal to Sadirov and his brother Rizvon, are based in Afghanistan.", "title": "KAZAKHSTAN : Tajik Islamic opposition condemns hostage-taking.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
