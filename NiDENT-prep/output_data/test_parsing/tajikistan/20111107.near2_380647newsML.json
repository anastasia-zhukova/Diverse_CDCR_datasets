Yuri Kushko DUSHANBE 1997-02-15 Islamic rebels holding 11 Russian and Western hostages have failed to keep their part of the deal with the Tajik government and release their captives, a presidential spokesman said on Saturday. \"_ Bakhrom Sadirov has not released the hostages, _\" the spokesman, Zafar Saidov, said. \"_ Their fate is unknown because from 4.30 p.m. (1130 GMT) all communications with their base have been down and all attempts to restore them have failed. _\"The hostages still held by the rebels include three U.N. observers $-- two from Switzerland and one from Ukraine $-- four workers with the U.N. refugee agency, two Russian television journalists and the Tajik security minister, Saidamir Zukhurov. The first hostages were captured early last week and the minister was abducted last weekend when he flew in to negotiate. \"_ We are concerned that the fighters are preparing to withdraw (from their base) to the mountains and intend to take the hostages with them, _\"Saidov said. Under the deal mediated by Russian officials, the Tajik government flew to Tajikistan from Afghanistan 35 supporters of brothers Bakhrom and Rizvon Sadirov. All the fighters, armed, have been freed and allowed to reach Sadirovs' base mountain base in a rocky region about 80 km (50 miles) from the Tajik capital Dushanbe and overlooking the village of Obigarm. Late on Friday the rebels freed three of their hostages $-- two Russian woman journalists and a driver. After the last group of fighters reached the Sadirovs' base, they were expected to set the remaining hostages free and let them walk about one mile (km) down the mountain to Obigarm where Russian and Tajik government negotiators were waiting. It was at that moment when the rebels apparently switched off their communications and their intentions remained unclear. Media reports have said the Tajik government concentrated a considerable military contingent near Obigarm and the rebels might either wait for the dark to fall to try and flee to the mountains leaving the hostages behind at their base. Another possibility was, as Saidov said, was that the rebels could take the hostages with them, using the captives as a possible human shield. The hostage crisis has highlighted the instability of Tajikistan, an impoverished mountaneous state bordering Afghanistan and China. President Imomali Rakhmonov and the leader of the country's united Islamist opposition Sayid Abdullo Nuri agreed on a ceasefire last December after a four-year civil war which left tens of thusands dead and many more displaced. Nuri has denounced the hostage-taking. The ceasefire seems to be holding, but rogue armed groups opposed to the Tajik president are still scattered across the country. Some fighters, like those loyal to the Sadirovs, are based in Afghanistan. In December, Sadirov's group took 23 people hostage, including seven U.N. observers and then released them. On Tuesday the rebels freed one of their current hostages, an Austrian U.N. observer who was reported to be seriously ill.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : Tajik rebels keep hostages despite release deal.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
