Yuri Kushko DUSHANBE 1997-02-14 An Islamic group holding more than a dozen hostages in Tajikistan, and demanding the release of fellow-fighters from Afghanistan, were joined on Friday by 25 of their comrades, a Russian official said. But it remained unclear if a hostage-for-fighter swap would go ahead, more than a week after the hostages were seized. Itar-Tass news agency said rebel leader Bakhram Sadirov had told Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Ignatenko that a helicopter with 25 fighters aboard had arrived at the rebels' base, some 80 km (50 miles) from the Tajik capital Dushanbe. Another helicopter was expected soon with 10 more rebel fighters, Ignatenko was quoted as saying. Ignatenko said after speaking to Sadirov that reports that one hostage, a United Nations military observer, had been killed were not true. The rebels' main conditions for releasing the hostages has been for Tajik authorities to fly in their comrades from neighbouring Afghanistan and allow the two groups to meet up. The hostages include three U.N. observers $-- two from Switzerland and one from Ukraine $-- four Russian journalists and four workers with the U.N. refugee agency. The reporters have been sending frequent reports to their employers in Moscow on the rebels' satellite telephone, but it is not clear to what extent they are simply reporting what their captors tell them to say. Tajikistan's security minister was seized last weekend when he tried to negotiate with the hostage-takers, who once backed the former Soviet republic's Islamic opposition but whose loyalties are now unclear. The hostage crisis has highlighted the instability of Tajikistan, an impoverished former Soviet republic bordering Afghanistan and China. Armed groups opposed to President Imomali Rakhmonov are scattered across the country and some fighters, such as those loyal to Bakhram Sadirov and his brother Rivzon, are based in neighbouring Afghanistan. Russia, whose soldiers help police the border with Afghanistan, has appealed for the early release of the captives. Itar-Tass news agency quoted Ignatenko as saying he had told Bakhram Sadirov to \"_ act like a man _\" . \"_ One should not hold women, journalists or foreigners, _\" he said. The crisis has been punctuated by threats, promises and ultimatums, including a pledge from Sadirov on Thursday that he would free the four reporters, seized when they travelled to the region to investigate the initial reports. Tajik government spokesman Zafar Saidov said the fighters were threatening to take their captives to the mountains and launch a guerrilla war unless their demands were met.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : Tajikistan meets some demands of hostage-takers.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
