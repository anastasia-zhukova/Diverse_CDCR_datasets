DUSHANBE 1997-02-10 Afghanistan's former military chief Ahmad Shah Masood will try on Monday to mediate an end to the week-old hostage crisis in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, a senior government source said. \"_ Masood arrived yesterday (Sunday), _\"the source told Reuters. \"_ Negotiations are continuing. _\"The hostage crisis began last Tuesday when a group of armed Tajik rebels seized four United Nations military observers $-- an Austrian, a Ukrainian and two Swiss nationals. The rebels later captured four Russian reporters and their driver and four workers with the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukharov, who flew in to negotiate with the hostage-takers, was seized early on Saturday. The hostages are being held by a group loyal to Rizvon Sadirov, who once fought for Tajikistan's armed Islamic opposition but whose loyalties are now unclear. The group is led by Rizvon's brother Bakhrom Sadirov, and is demanding free passage for colleagues based in neighbouring Afghanistan to return to Tajikistan. Masood's forces, fighting the Taleban Islamic rulers in Kabul, control the area of northern Afghanistan where Sadirov's fighters are based. Tajikistan's Islamist opposition fighters have operated from bases inside Afghanistan in a four-year civil war with the secular government, although a truce has held since December. \"_ We expect Rizvon to come back soon, _\"said the government source. A U.N. representative had said he hoped the hostages could be freed on Sunday after the Tajik government promised to send helicopters to Afghanistan to pick up 40 rebels and bring them to Bakhrom Sadirov's base. Predictions of a quick end to the crisis have been dashed in the past. The Tajik authorities have issued daily statements saying the hostages would be released but a helicopter sent on Friday to collect them returned empty.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : Afghan war chief mediates in Tajik hostage crisis.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
