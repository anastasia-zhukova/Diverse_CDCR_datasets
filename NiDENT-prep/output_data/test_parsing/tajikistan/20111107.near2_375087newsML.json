Adam Tanner MOSCOW 1996-02-14 Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin early on Friday warned Russia will take all necessary means to save the lives of Russian and Western hostages in Tajikistan, but said he hoped they would be released by Friday morning. Speaking to reporters after a late-night government meeting on Thursday, Chernomyrdin said Moscow, which has a sizeable military presence in Tajikistan, had alerted its security officials about the situation after a United Nations military observer was reported killed, Itar-Tass news agency said. \"_ The leadership of all Russian military services and the Foreign Ministry have been instructed to do all possible on their part, _\"Tass quoted Chernomyrdin as saying. \"_ We have warned our armed forces and we ask the government of (Imomali) Rakhmonov to take all necessary measures, _\" he said. Chernomyrdin's late-night remarks came after Russian journalists held captive by Islamic fighters Bakhram and Rizvon Sadirov reported that a United Nations military observer held hostage had been shot dead. The prime minister said neither Russia nor Tajikistan could confirm the reports, and the United Nations said at its New York headquarters that it could not get independent confirmation of the incident. The Russian reporters have sent frequent stories from their captivity, but it is not clear to what extent they are simply reporting what their captors tell them to say. President Rakhmonov, helped by Russian border guards, is struggling to maintain his grip on mountainous Tajikistan, but there are armed groups both across the country and in neighbouring Afghanistan. Sadirov's rebel group holding the captives once fought for the armed Tajik Islamic opposition, but its loyalties are now unclear. The captors seized their first hostages more than a week ago and they are now holding three U.N. observers $-- two Swiss and a Ukrainian $-- along_with four Russian journalists, four members of the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR and the Tajik Security Minister, who was seized when he arrived to negotiate. International organisations have pulled out_of Tajikistan, fearing for the safety of their staff. As Russia's patience in the hostage situation appeared to grow thin, Chernomyrdin said Moscow would also consider sending Defence Minister Igor Rodionov to Tajikistan, Tass reported. About 20,000 Russians carry out peacekeeping duties in the former Soviet republic, torn apart by a four-year civil war, and guard its remote, mountainous frontier with Afghanistan. President Boris Yeltsin, who is maintaining a limited work schedule as he recovers from pneumonia, is following the situation, Chernomyrdin said according_to the Tass report. As he raised the spectre of a more active Russian response to the situation, Chernomyrdin said the Tajik president was ready to meet the rebels' demands. \"_ Imomali Rakhmonov told me he plans to travel to the place of these events. He also gave the order to fulfill all of Sadirov's demands, _\"Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying. The rebel leader had demanded that the Tajik government bring 40 rebel fighters from Afghanistan to his base 80 km (50 miles) from the regional capital Dushanbe. The hostages were expected to be released on Thursday after the Tajik government said it had flown in the rebels to swap for the captives. But talks broke down over the details, a spokesman for the Tajik president said.", "title": "RUSSIA : Russia issues warning in Tajik hostage crisis.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
