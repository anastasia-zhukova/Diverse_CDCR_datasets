Yuri Kushko DUSHANBE 1997-02-09 Tajikistan's president left for talks to try to end the country's hostage crisis as a U.N. official said he hoped the Tajik security minister and other captives held by rebels could be freed on Sunday. President Imomali Rakhmonov was flying to the southern town of Kulyab for the talks, a presidential spokesman said. A United Nations representative said he hoped the hostages, who include U.N. workers, could be freed on Sunday after the Tajik government promised to send helicopters to Afghanistan, pick up 40 rebels and bring them to the base of hostage-taker Bakhrom Sadirov. But hopes of a quick end to the crisis have been dashed in the past. The Tajik authorities have issued daily statements saying that the hostages would be released and a helicopter sent on Friday to collect them returned empty. The crisis, which has marred celebrations to mark the end of the Ramadan month of fasting in the Moslem former Soviet republic, started on Tuesday when a group of Islamic opposition rebels seized four U.N. military observers $-- an Austrian, a Ukranian and two Swiss nationals. The rebels later captured four Russian reporters and their driver and four workers with the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukharov, who flew in to negotiate with the hostage-takers, was seized early on Saturday. The captors belong to a group loyal to Rizvon Sadirov, who once fought for Tajikistan's armed Islamic opposition but whose loyalties are now unclear. They are led by Rizvon's brother Bakhrom Sadirov and are demanding free passage for colleagues based in neighbouring Afghanistan to return to Tajikistan. Tajik presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov said Rakhmonov had left for Kulyab, a town some 200 km (125 miles) south of the capital Dushanbe, to meet Akhmad Shah Masood. Masood, together with Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, controls the north of Afghanistan, an area which provides a refuge for Tajikistan's Islamic opposition. Saidov said Rizvon Sadirov might join the talks. Russia's Interfax news agency, whose Dushanbe correspondent is among the captives, appealed to Sadirov to release them. \"_ We appeal to you as a military man and as a Moslem, on the occasion of the Ramadan holiday, to release the U.N. officials and the Russian journalists, first and foremost the women, who you are holding, _\" the agency's appeal said. The captives are being held near the town of Obirgam which is in a mountaneous area some 80 km (50 miles) east of Dushanbe. The crisis highlights the problems Rakhmonov faces in controlling his country. Western observers estimate Rakhmonov only controls about 15-20 percent of the republic, with around half in the hands of the Islamic guerrillas. International humaniatarian organisations are already pulling out_of Tajikistan due_to the kidnappings. The International Committee for the Red Cross said on Thursday it was suspending operations in the Central Asian state, and non-essential U.N. personnel began leaving the republic on Saturday.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : Tajik president makes bid to end hostage crisis.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
