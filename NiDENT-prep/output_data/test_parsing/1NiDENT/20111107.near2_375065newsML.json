Yuri Kushko DUSHANBE 1997-02-13 Tajik rebels holding more than a dozen Western and Russian hostages said they killed a U.N. military observer among their captives after a planned hostage-for-rebel swap failed to take place, Itar-Tass news agency said on Thursday. United Nations sources in the Tajik capital Dushanbe declined to comment and Western diplomats expressed caution about the report, which was also carried by Interfax news agency. An Itar-Tass correspondent, herself one of the hostages being held near Obigarm, 80 km (50 miles) east of Dushanbe, reported the fatal shooting of the U.N. military observer by satellite phone to her office in Moscow. An Interfax journalist, also a hostage, reported the shooting. Neither journalist named the observer. The two reporters have sent frequent stories from captivity, but it is not clear to what extent they are reporting what their captors tell them to say. The hostages include three U.N. military observers $-- two Swiss and a Ukrainian $-- four Russian reporters and four workers with the U.N. refugee agency. The rebels also seized Tajikistan's security minister on Saturday when he flew in to negotiate the captives' release. In Switzerland, a defence ministry spokesman called the report that a hostage had been killed \"_ not credible _\"and said the Swiss government was still seeking information from Tajikistan and from United Nations. The Tajik government earlier on Thursday said it flew in 40 rebels from Afghanistan ahead_of a rebel deadline, but government spokesman Zafar Saidov said their release was delayed by haggling over details of the swap. But Bakhron Sadirov, who is in Obigarm with his brother Rivzon, told the hostage Interfax and Tass correspondents that no rebel fighters had been transported from northern Afghanistan and that five had been killed. Interfax quoted Bakhrom as saying the rebels had killed the U.N. military observer after the Tajik authorities failed to meet their conditions. \"_ The hostages held by the Sadirov brothers ask the government of Russia and Tajikistan to take all measures for the exchange of the hostages, _\"Interfax correspondent Suraiye Sobirova told her agency. \"_ Otherwise all the hostages will be killed. _\"In Moscow, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was informed of the situation on Thursday evening while chairing a cabinet meeting, Tass said. He was expected to telephone the Tajik president on Thursday night. Interfax said Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov had condemned the reported killing \"_ in the most decisive way. _\"The United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan has about 45 military personnel in the republic in an operation aimed at ending a four-year civil war between the secular government and Islamist opposition forces. Sadirov's group took 23 people hostage, including seven U.N. observers, last December. All the hostages were later released.", "title": "TAJIKISTAN : Rebels reportedly kill U.N. hostage in Tajikistan.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
