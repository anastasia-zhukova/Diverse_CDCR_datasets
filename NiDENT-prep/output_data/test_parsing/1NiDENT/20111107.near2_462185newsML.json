Howard Goller JERUSALEM 1997-03-23 Israel tightened security around its cities and considered partly suspending peace talks with the Palestinians on Sunday following an Islamist suicide bombing and threats of more to come. Underscoring tensions, Israeli border policemen shot and wounded two Palestinians at a roadblock outside Jerusalem after one of them tried to flee, police said. The militant group Hamas, which claimed responsibility for the killing of three Israeli women in Friday's bombing of a Tel Aviv cafe, threatened to launch further attacks if Israel went on building a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep building and summoned his inner security cabinet to a meeting on Sunday after accusing Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority of having given Hamas the green light for the suicide bombing. Netanyahu's communications chief David Bar-Illan said the cabinet ministers would meet to decide how to proceed in talks with Arafat's Palestinian Authority $-- \"_ if at all _\". \"_ There may be a suspension of at_least any kind of political negotiations and a decision to concentrate only on security matters until we see some kind of cooperation from the Palestinians, _\"Bar-Illan told Reuters. Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud party, was elected 10 months ago on a promise to pursue both peace and security. Now his peace talks are in crisis and the suicide bombers he vowed to repel have come back. \"_ Unless there is security, he will not proceed with the negotiations on political issues. That_'s it, _\"Bar-Illan said. Security forces threw up protective rings around Israeli cities which planned to go ahead with carnivals for the Purim holiday commemorating the rescue of Jews from genocide in ancient Persia. \"_ In a big way we have surrounded the entire area where an event will take place with a ring of policemen so that anyone entering will pass through bands of police, _\"said Yaacov Shoval, deputy chief of the central Tel Aviv police district. Palestinians, shrugging off Bar-Illan's comments, said talks were already at a deadlock and blamed the lack of security on Netanyahu's groundbreaking last week for the Jewish settlement on a hilltop that Palestinians call Jabal Abu Ghneim. \"_ Since the moment the bulldozers started work in Jabal Abu Ghneim, the Israeli-Palestinian talks have stopped, _\"said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, general-secretary of Arafat's cabinet. \"_ There is no_more security, stability and the current situation warns of an explosion at any moment, _\"he told Reuters. Israeli and PLO security services have met during the last two days. Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said he hoped to meet Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian Preventive Security chief in the West Bank, on Sunday as planned a week ago. \"_ We need these meetings. These meetings bring about better coordination for both groups, _\"Kahalani said. Israel and the PLO are partners to self-rule peace accords launched in 1993. Fierce Israeli-Arab clashes flared in the West Bank town of Hebron on Saturday for a second straight day. Israeli soldiers fired live ammunition, rubber bullets and teargas at hundreds of Arab protesters who threw petrol bombs and rocks. Hospital officials said at_least 20 Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds. The Israeli army said soldiers fired live ammunition \"_ when their lives were in danger _\". Another 80 Arabs were treated for other injuries or teargas inhalation.", "title": "ISRAEL : Israel tightens security, weighs peace talks limit.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
