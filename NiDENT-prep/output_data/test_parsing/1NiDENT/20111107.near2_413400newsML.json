James Craig LIMA 1997-03-02 President Alberto Fujimori left Lima on Sunday for the Dominican Republic for talks on Peru's 75 $- day-old hostage crisis, but played down rumours he was seeking asylum for Marxist rebels. Fujimori boarded the presidential plane without speaking to reporters for the flight to Santo Domingo for a meeting with the Caribbean nation's President Leonel Fernandez that would include talks on the crisis. A Government Palace spokesman said Fujimori's plane was due_to land at Santo Domingo airport Sunday afternoon. His trip came on the eve of an eighth round of face-to-face talks in Lima between the government and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) to peacefully secure the release of 72 hostages held at the Japanese ambassador's home. A seventh round of talks last Thursday left officials upbeat that progress was being made toward ending the crisis, but the MRTA cast a cloud on that optimism over the weekend by unfurling defiant new banners criticising the government. No time was given for Monday's talks. Travelling with his teenage son, Kenji, and six schoolmates, several government ministers and congressmen, Fujimori was seen off at Lima's Group Eight air force base by government crisis point-man Domingo Palermo. Palermo and Fujimori met for three hours on Saturday at Government Palace to discuss the crisis. Sunday's one-day visit to Santo Domingo $-- Fujimori's second in less than a month $-- fuelled rumours he was negotiating an eventual asylum in the Dominican Republic for the roughly 15 rebels holed up in the diplomatic compound. Fujimori has floated the idea of asylum for the rebels as part of a deal to free their captives. Fujimori was non-committal Saturday when asked if rebels would be given one-way tickets to the Caribbean island. \"_ It_'s a trip where we are going to work on the possibilities of boosting relations between both countries, and it does_ n't necessarily have to do with the possibility of asylum, _\"he told local radio. \"_ However, (the hostage crisis) will be discussed, _\"he added, giving no_further details. Fujimori met the Dominican president on Feb. 5 during a four-hour stopover at Santo Domingo airport, but the Peruvian embassy there denied they had discussed offering refuge to the rebels. Fujimori was leaving Peru amid controversy, as the Argentine human rights group Mothers of Plaza de Mayo lashed out at him for spurning their offer to mediate in the hostage crisis. They accused Fujimori of torture and oppression. The Mothers sent a delegation led by their president, Hebe de Bonafini, to Peru hoping to meet Fujimori and visit the besieged residence. On Sunday, after a week of being repeatedly snubbed, they announced they were giving up and going back to Argentina. The delegation, whose members wear white scarves on their heads, also received a hostile reception from the Peruvian media, which accused them of naivety for accepting a guerrilla invitation to mediate. The Vatican, the Canadian government and the Red Cross are mediating in the talks to end the hostage crisis. In a letter to Fujimori obtained by Reuters, the Mothers accused the president of setting out to humiliate them and of sending police and soldiers in disguise to harass them. The Mothers accused Fujimori of heading a \"_ virtual military dictatorship, _\"using torture and holding 5,500 political prisoners. Peru has more than 3,000 people behind bars for \"_ terrorism. _\"The government admits that about 300 may be innocent and is examining their cases, but human rights groups say the number wrongly jailed could be as high as 1,000. In Tokyo, the Japanese television network TV Asahi said Peru has decided not to press charges against one of its reporters and his interpreter for making an unauthorised entry into the diplomatic residence. The Peruvian authorities had been considering charges of terrorism and treason against Tsuyoshi Hitomi, 27, a New York $- based reporter for the commercial network, but decided there was no evidence of such activities. Fujimori has repeatedly ruled out considering the MRTA's main demand for the release of their jailed comrades but has indicated he might make other concessions. The rebels originally took hundreds of hostages when they stormed the residence on Dec. 17, but let most of them go early in the crisis. They have held onto their most powerful bargaining chips, including Fujimori's younger brother, two government ministers, the envoys of Japan and Bolivia, as_well_as two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats.", "title": "peru : Fujimori flies to Caribbean for Peru crisis talks.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
