James Craig LIMA 1997-03-28 Japan Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Friday he did not foresee dramatic progress soon in talks aimed at ending the 101-day Lima hostage crisis, contrasting with official optimism in Peru. \"_ I ca_ n't say with confidence that there will be significant progress, _\"Hashimoto told reporters in Tokyo. \"_ I am not optimistic, _\"he said without elaborating. In Lima, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said on Thursday obstacles remain but the government and Marxist rebels holding 72 men at the Japanese ambassador's home were progressing toward a peaceful end to the hostage siege. The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) hostage $- takers also said the two sides had moved closer but called news reports of an imminent deal \"_ simple speculation, _\"adding that major issues remain to be resolved. \"_ The sides are getting closer but the main demand for the release of prisoners still has to be addressed, _\"Comrade Alejandro, an MRTA military leader in Peru's central jungle, told Reuters. Rebels stormed the diplomatic compound Dec. 17 and took hundreds of party guests hostage to demand the freedom of some 450 jailed comrades, a demand the government has rejected. The MRTA, meanwhile, has moved at_least 70 fighters into the Peruvian capital since last October to back up comrades inside the residence, according_to a secret intelligence report obtained on Friday by Reuters. The two-page National Intelligence Service report, dated March 12, said the MRTA transported \"_ by different means personnel and arms to form '_ External Support Groups _' _\"in case talks \"_ do not reach a good conclusion. _\"Direct talks between the government and MRTA $-- broken off since March 12 $-- are expected to resume Monday or Tuesday amid reports the rebels have agreed to take asylum in Cuba as part of a broader crisis-ending deal. Fujimori's interpretation was in keeping with a growing sense in Peru that momentum is building for an accord to end what has become Latin America's longest hostage siege. Even his opponents in Congress saw a quick end to the crisis. \"_ The way negotiations are progressing, I believe they can come up with a solution in the short term, _\"Congressman Alejandro Santa Maria Silva of the Aprista party told Reuters. Diplomats, legislators and analysts all say that, although they foresee tough discussions on how many, if any, imprisoned rebels would be released, that should not be an unsurmountable hurdle when face-to-face contacts resume. Good Friday dawned amid calm at the residence in Lima's upscale San Isidro district after an alert about midnight on rumours a hostage would be freed for medical reasons. The rumours were granted extra weight when two police ambulances parked at a square near the mansion. On Thursday, the president boosted growing optimism in Lima that a solution to the siege was in sight, saying he was confident the energetic work of talks' guarantors, hammering out a deal acceptable to both sides, \"_ is going to bear fruit. _\"Fujimori also hinted he still had some differences with Tokyo on how to end the crisis. \"_ Perhaps we live the situation here more intimately. In Japan $... there is a distance that does not allow a precise perception of what is going on and what might happen, _\"he said. Rebels issued a four-point statement, saying a \"_ peaceful solution for the crisis is in the government's hands and will come about if they address our demands. _\"The MRTA said the group was willing to negotiate a reduced number of freed comrades as long as they are high-ranking rebels. An MRTA international spokeswoman, however, hinted the group would also accept the release of ill prisoners. \"_ Now it_'s the turn for the government to show its good faith by releasing the sick prisoners. That would signal a positive turn in negotiations, _\"Norma Velazco said in an interview published on the MRTA's Internet web site.", "title": "PERU : Japan PM differs with crisis optimism in Peru.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
