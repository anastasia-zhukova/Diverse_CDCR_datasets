TAIPEI 1997-03-10 A Taiwan airliner hijacked to China on Monday touched down safely in Taipei after an unprecedented direct crossing of the Taiwan strait from the rival communist Chinese mainland. The Far East Air Transport Boeing 757 landed at Taipei's domestic Sungshan Airport shortly after 8.00 p.m. (1200 GMT) and quickly was surrounded by police and rescue vehicles.
