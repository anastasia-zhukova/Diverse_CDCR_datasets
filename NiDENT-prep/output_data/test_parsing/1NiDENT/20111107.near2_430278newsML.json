Lawrence Chung TAIPEI 1997-03-10 Relieved passengers, safely back in Taipei, praised airline and government authorities in Taiwan and China on Monday for the sound handling of their plane's hijacking to the mainland. The 160-odd passengers and crew from Far East Air Transport's Flight 128 returned to Taipei on Monday night after the Boeing 757 was commandeered to China's southeastern port of Xiamen by an unemployed Taiwan journalist. \"_ The Xiamen authorities really treated us well when we were there. They were very reassuring, _\"passenger Wang Kuo told reporters at Taipei's Sungshan airport. Taiwan lawmaker Kao Yu-jen said Xiamen's mayor came aboard to console passengers and gave them food and gifts. He even provided mobile telephones with which to call family in Taiwan. \"_ I felt a_lot_of human warmth, _\"Kao said. Passenger Peng Yi-hsin said police in Xiamen came aboard and overpowered hijacker Liu Shan-chung with little commotion. \"_ They quickly suppressed him. He had no chance to fight back, _\"Peng said. Liu, who cited \"_ political repression _\"in Taiwan as his motive, remained in the custody of Xiamen police. Monday's hijacking was the 13th in a spate of Taiwan air piracy cases in the 1990s $-- but the first to go to communist China from nationalist Taiwan. The previous cases all involved mainland Chinese hijacking planes to Taiwan and seeking asylum on the island, which China has regarded as a rebel-held province since the two split after a civil war in 1949. Far East gave each passenger T$1,000 ($36) for the inconvenience but customers said the flight crew handled the affair so well there was hardly any sense of crisis. \"_ No one panicked, _\"said one woman who had cradled her infant son aboard the plane. \"_ All the flight attendants remained very calm, even when one had to tell us the plane was being hijacked. _\"Hijacker Liu had doused himself with gasoline and ordered the plane's captain to fly to Xiamen. \"_ The only time I felt something was wrong was when someone was talking very loud and there was a smell of gasoline on the plane, _\"said one woman. Crew chief Kao Yung-chen called the hijacking needless. \"_ Why would anyone want to hijack an aircraft? _\"she said. \"_ It_'s so easy to buy a ticket to fly anywhere in the mainland. _\"", "title": "TAIWAN : Relieved Taiwan passengers praise hijack handling.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
