JERUSALEM 1997-03-23 Israel said on Sunday the Palestinian Authority was conditioning cooperation in fighting \"_ terror _\"on a change in the political situation. \"_ Today and for several days the security mechanisms of the Palestinians have not cooperated with the General Security Services $-- the Shin Bet $-- in what is connected to foiling terrorist actions and in practise they have conditioned that on a change in the political situation, _\"Major General Moshe Yaalon, head of military intelligence, told a news conference. Yaalon again repeated the Israeli charge that Palestinian guerrilla groups had recently been given the impression they had a green light from the Palestinian Authority to commit attacks against Israel. \"_ In light of the situation, we estimate that as long as Arafat does not cause the terrorist organisations to understand that there is no green light to commit attacks, we are expecting more attacks, _\"he said. An Islamist suicide bomber killed three Israeli women and wounded scores of other people at a Tel Aviv sidewalk cafe on Friday. Yaalon said Arafat's forces had yet to disarm militants and destroy their infrastructure. The general said that in order for that to happen \"_ there is a need that they receive an order from Arafat himself. An order like that has still not been given _\".", "title": "ISRAEL : Israel says PLO links security to politics.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
