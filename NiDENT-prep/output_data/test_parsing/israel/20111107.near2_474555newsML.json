Howard Goller JERUSALEM 1997-03-28 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after meeting a U.S. envoy on Friday that a Palestinian pledge to fight \"_ terrorism _\" was not enough and only action against militants would salvage peacemaking. \"_ If the Palestinian side fulfils its commitments $-- again not for just a day or two $-- but if we see a basic change during the coming period, we will be able to return the peace process to its course, _\" he said after meeting envoy Dennis Ross. Israeli-PLO talks have been in crisis since Netanyahu broke ground last week on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, sparking Palestinian violence including nine days of West Bank clashes and a killer suicide bombing in Tel Aviv last week. Israel has accused Arafat of giving a tacit \"_ green light _\" for Islamist militant attacks. The PLO denies the charge. Ross, on a two-day Israel-PLO emergency mission, appeared to come up short_of saving Middle East peace efforts as he prepared to return to Washington to report to U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. \"_ They will want to consider the report before deciding what are the most appropriate next steps that might be taken, _\"Ross told reporters after more than three hours of meeting Netanyahu and Israel's defence and foreign ministers. \"_ One thing that_'s clear as I leave is that it_'s essential to re-establish calm, _\"Ross said. Backed by tanks and helicopters, thousands of Israeli police and soldiers remained on high alert as clashes erupted. In Hebron, Israeli soldiers dispersed scores of Palestinian stone-throwers. Witnesses said 25 protesters arrived at hospital with rubber bullet wounds and two with wounds from live ammunition. Palestinian police helped contain the riots. On Jerusalem's Temple Mount, stone-throwers pelted Israeli police after Moslem Friday prayers at al-Aqsa mosque. Police held their fire while guards from the Islamic Trust helped to disperse the protesters. Netanyahu said that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, when he met Ross in the Moroccan capital Rabat on Thursday, had assured the envoy that \"_ terrorism _\" would stop. \"_ But what we_ 're interested in right_now are not verbal assurances in Rabat but action $-- actually deeds and words here $-- because this is where the terrorism is exploding, _\" he said. The Israeli leader demanded the arrest of militants, the dismantling of guerrilla groups and tight cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. Netanyahu denied that Ross had asked Israel for a reciprocal gesture, telling reporters : \"_ I want to say that altogether we spoke only about the issue of terrorism. We did not speak at all about details of continuing the diplomatic process. _\"Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said after meeting Ross earlier in the day that the only way out_of the crisis was for Israel to stop work on the 6,500-home settlement on a hilltop the Israelis call Har Homa and the Arabs call Jabal Abu Ghneim. \"_ Mr Netanyahu knows very well and if he takes one look in the mirror he would realise the reasons for this escalation of violence and counter-violence and Mr Netanyahu realises that settlement and peace do not go together, _\"Erekat told reporters. Arabs view East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied in 1967 and annexed, as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The violence overshadowed Easter celebrations on Good Friday at the traditional site of Jesus's crucifixion in Jerusalem. Industry officials said tourism was down 15 to 18 percent during the peak season around Easter, when Christians mark the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, and Passover, the Jewish holiday marking the biblical exodus from Egypt. Arafat arrived in Tunis on Friday to brief President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali on the crisis before he was due_to fly home to the self-ruled Gaza Strip.", "title": "ISRAEL : Netanyahu says only PLO crackdown will save peace.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
