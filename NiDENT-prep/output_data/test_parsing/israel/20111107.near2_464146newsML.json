BEIRUT 1997-03-24 The militant Islamist group Hamas said on Monday the Middle East peace process was dying and it was time to deliver the final blow. \"_ We in the Islamic Resistance, Hamas, call upon our people and all Islamic, Palestinian, and Arab forces to deliver the mercy bullet to the dying peace process, and to unite efforts in resisting the criminal plots of the enemy, _\"Hamas said in a statement faxed to an international news agency in Beirut. Hamas, which claimed responsibility for a Tel Aviv suicide bombing that killed three Israeli women on Friday, called on the Palestinian police to stop cooperating with Israeli authorities. \"_ Halting the intelligence cooperation with the enemy $... is the preliminary and obvious response to his settlement practices and plots, _\"Hamas said. \"_ We call upon the Palestinian police to stop trying to halt the Intifada which is the only path out_of the current impasse of the Palestinian cause, _\" it added. The Hamas call coincided with a statement on Monday by Mohammad Dahlan, Palestinian Preventive Security chief in the Gaza Strip, that the Palestinian Authority had stopped its security activities and its intelligence cooperation with Israel because Israel was violating agreements by continuing to establish Jewish settlements. Israel last week began work on building 6,500 homes for Jews on the outskirts of Arab East Jerusalem, angering Palestinians who want the eastern part of the city to become capital of a Palestinian state, and sparking violent demonstrations.", "title": "LEBANON : Hamas urges \"_ mercy bullet _\" to finish peace process.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
