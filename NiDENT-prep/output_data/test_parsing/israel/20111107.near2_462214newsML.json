Daniel Sternoff JERUSALEM 1997-03-23 Palestinians on Sunday began to feel the bite of an Israeli blockade of the West Bank and Gaza imposed after an Islamist suicide bombing, officials said. \"_ All the crossing points with Israel are closed to transportation, trade and the movement of people, _\"Hisham Disouqi, Palestinian Authority coordinator of security at checkpoints with Israel, told Reuters. He said only the Rafah checkpoint between Egypt and self-ruled Gaza was open to passenger traffic. Israel sealed off the occupied Palestinian areas on Friday after a Hamas Islamic militant killed himself and three Israeli women in the blast at a Tel Aviv cafe. A spokesman for Israel's military occupation authority said the closure would remain in force for an indefinite period amidst fears of more attacks. \"_ There is total closure. Only VIPs and humanitarian cases are allowed to exit, _\" spokesman Hanan Rubin said. The closure $-- which Palestinians condemn as collective punishment $-- reversed months of gradual easing of restrictions on the movement of people and goods between Israel and the occupied areas. Palestinian workers were the closure's first economic casualties. Said al-Mudallal, Palestinian Labour Ministry employment bureau chief, said some 48,000 Palestinian labourers with permits to work in Israel and half that many illegal workers were now trapped in the West Bank and Gaza. \"_ The loss to the Palestinian territories is one to one-and-a-half million dollars daily, _\"Mudallal said. \"_ Before the closures, unemployment in Gaza was between 45 and 50 percent. Now it will jump to 60. In the West Bank, joblessness will rise from 35 to 40 percent to 45 to 47 percent, _\" he said. Palestinian businesses dependent on imports and exports through Israel ground to a halt. \"_ When Carni and Erez (checkpoints) are closed, we stop work completely, _\" said Maher Ali, a manager at Gaza's al-Walid Trade and Industry Company. \"_ Carni and Erez are like the water and the oxygen we breathe in Gaza. Both are controlled by the Israeli government, _\" he said. Even foreign nationals and international aid workers were trapped in the Gaza Strip. \"_ Only diplomats can exit, _\" said Guy Amran, a non-commissioned officer at the Erez checkpoint. Dierdre Black, an Irish administrator for a Gaza lawyer, said Israel had barred her and a number of other foreigners from leaving Gaza and others were afraid to enter the Strip for fear they would be barred from leaving. \"_ Even if you have a plane ticket to leave you can_ not go out through the checkpoint, _\"Black told Reuters. Israel last sealed off the West Bank and Gaza in October amidst warnings guerrillas would launch attacks to mark the first anniversary of the assassination in Malta of a leader of the Islamic Jihad movement.", "title": "ISRAEL : Palestinians feel bite of renewed Israeli blockade.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
