Colleen Siegel JERUSALEM 1997-03-23 Israel tightened security around its cities on Sunday and said it could suspend peace talks with the Palestinians following an Islamist suicide bombing and threats of more to come. An Israeli government official said political talks might be stopped while liaison on security matters continued. Underscoring tensions, Israeli security forces shot and wounded two Palestinians at a roadblock near Jerusalem and fired teargas to disperse Arab protesters who hurled five petrol bombs at them near the West Bank town of Hebron, witnesses said. Three Palestinians were treated for teargas inhalation. Security forces threw up protective rings around Israeli cities which went ahead with carnivals for the Purim holiday marking the rescue of Jews from genocide in ancient Persia. Police with dogs stood at every intersection along Tel Aviv's fashionable Dizengoff street, closed to traffic for the Purim holiday which has been marred by tragedies etched in Israeli minds over the last few years. A caller to Israeli police claimed responsibility in the name of the militant group Hamas for the killing of three Israeli women in Friday's bombing of a Tel Aviv cafe. Hamas threatened to launch further attacks if Israel went on building a Jewish settlement begun last week in Arab East Jerusalem at Jabal Abu Ghneim, known as Har Homa in Israel. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep building and summoned his inner security cabinet to a meeting on Sunday after accusing Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority of having given Hamas the green light for the suicide bombing. Netanyahu's communications chief David Bar-Illan said the cabinet ministers would meet to decide how to proceed in talks with Arafat's Palestinian Authority $-- \"_ if at all _\" . \"_ There may be a suspension of at_least any kind of political negotiations and a decision to concentrate only on security matters until we see some kind of cooperation from the Palestinians, _\"Bar-Illan told Reuters. Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky said peace talks should be suspended. \"_ We had information that Arafat gave a green light for violence. We have to stop all negotiations and demand that he take steps, _\"Sharansky told Israel's army radio. Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud party, was elected 10 months ago on a promise to pursue both peace and security. Now his peace talks are in crisis and the suicide bombers he vowed to repel have come back. \"_ Unless there is security, he will not proceed with the negotiations on political issues. That_'s it, _\"Bar-Illan said. Palestinians, shrugging off Bar Illan's threat, said negotiations were already at a deadlock anyway and blamed the lack of security on Netanyahu's groundbreaking last week for the Jewish settlement at Jabal Abu Ghneim, or Har Homa. Palestinian Authority Preventive Security chief Jibril Rajoub said after meeting Israeli Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani in Jerusalem the choice was Israel's. \"_ The situation deteriorated after the attempt at (building) a settlement on Har Homa, something nobody needed. The government of Israel has to decide if it really wants peace and security or if it wants settlements, _\"Jibril told army radio. Both Jibril and Kahalani described their meeting, scheduled before the bombing, as good. Kahalani's office said a hotline was established between the two officials. \"_ We reached the conclusion that together we have to do everything so that there are no extremists who will destroy the peace process, _\"Kahalani told reporters. Rajoub vowed the Palestinians would \"_ take all necesssary steps _\" . Netanyahu had accused Arafat of tacitly encouraging Hamas to strike against Israel by freeing Hamas militants arrested last year after suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel. A leader of Hamas military wing, Ibrahim al-Makadmeh, previously reported under Palestinian Authority arrest, is still at large, Palestinian Attorney General Khaled al-Qidra said. Makadmeh was freed from prison by Arafat earlier this month.", "title": "ISRAEL : Israel may limit peace talks, tightens security.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
