JERUSALEM 1996-03-24 The Palestinian Authority, accused by Israel of failing to cooperate with it on security issues, said on Sunday such liaison depended on progress in peace talks. Asked to react to Israel's charge earlier in the day that the Authority was conditioning cooperation in preventing militants' attacks on Israel on political change, Ahmed Abd al-Rahman, secretary general of the Authority's cabinet, told Reuters : \"_ The security coordination is linked to the development of the political peace process and they are not separate. _\"Referring to the Lebanese general who heads Israel's client South Lebanon Army militia in the Jewish state's Lebanon occupation zone, Rahman added : \"_ They are wrong if they think that the Palestinian Authority is a copy of Antoine Lahd's forces in south Lebanon. _\"Israeli Major General Moshe Yaalon, head of military intelligence, told a news conference earlier on Sunday in Jerusalem : \"_ Today and for several days the security mechanisms of the Palestinians have not cooperated with the General Security Services $-- the Shin Bet $-- in what is connected to foiling terrorist actions and in practice they have conditioned that on a change in the political situation. _\"Strained contacts between Israel and the Palestinian Authority have reached the brink of breaking over an Islamist suicide bombing at a Tel Aviv cafe on Friday that killed three Israeli women. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused the Palestinian Authority of giving a green light to attacks against Israel by militants opposed to the peace process. Palestinians have denied the charge. They say Netanyahu spurred militants to action by breaking ground last week on a new Jewish settlement on Arab East Jerusalem's outskirts. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, asked on the CBS programme \"_ Face the Nation _\" if Arafat had given a \"_ green light _\" for violence, said : \"_ There is clearly perception of the green light but no concrete evidence. _\"Albright said Arafat had to do more to stop violence. \"_ There have been efforts on his part, 100 percent efforts, to stop the violence and the terrorism, but the result has not been 100 percent, _\" she said. \"_ He has condemned the violent acts, but there needs to be some improvement. _\"", "title": "ISRAEL : Palestinians say security talks, peace moves linked.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
