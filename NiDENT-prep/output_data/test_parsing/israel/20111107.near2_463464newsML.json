WASHINGTON 1997-03-24 The White House said on Monday Jordan's King Hussein would meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on April 1 and denied that the Middle East peace process was unravelling. Hussein had been scheduled to meet Clinton on March 18, but his visit was postponed after a Jordanian soldier shot dead seven Israeli girls near the Israel-Jordan border on March 13 and after Clinton had knee surgery on March 14. In addition to the killing of the Israeli girls, an Islamist suicide bomber killed three Israeli women at a Tel Aviv cafe on Friday. The bombing further injured an Israel-PLO relationship already strained over the construction Israel launched last week for a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. In an effort to breathe new life into the peace process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak have all met Clinton in Washington over the past six weeks. Asked if the peace process was now unravelling, McCurry replied : \"_ No $... Manifestly the majority of Arabs and Jews want to see peace in that region. They have seen the benefits and the dividend of peace and they want leaders, and they want those who help the parties, to continue to make progress. _\" \"_ They do_ n't want to see the cycle descend to violence and terror, which are the weapons of those who are enemies of peace, _\" he said. On Sunday, Netanyahu sought to blame the Palestinian Authority for the recent incidents, suggesting it had given a \"_ green light _\" for the resumption of violence. Asked if the United States believed Arafat had done enough to prevent this, McCurry avoided singling out the Palestinian leader but suggested the Palestinian Authority could do more. \"_ The United States has said that everyone has to work even harder to prevent violence and terrorism, _\" the spokesman said, adding that Clinton had raised the issue when he met Arafat in Washington on March 3. \"_ The president made it clear that $... all parties have to do everything they can to thwart terrorists, _\" McCurry said, adding : \"_ He talked specifically about those things that the Palestinian Authority can do to curb and thwart terrorism. _\"", "title": "USA : Jordan's Hussein to meet Clinton on April 1.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
