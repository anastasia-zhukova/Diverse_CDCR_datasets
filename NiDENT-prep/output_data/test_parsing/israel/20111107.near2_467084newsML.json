Jonathan Wright CAIRO 1997-03-25 Events in Jerusalem this month have cast a pall of doom and gloom across the Arab world, widening the gap between cautious Arab governments and angry domestic public opinion, analysts said on Tuesday. The United States, by vetoing two U.N. Security Council resolutions critical of Israel, has inadvertently elbowed Arab mediators out_of the picture without convincing them that U.S. diplomacy alone can save Middle East peace talks, they added. The catch-phrase \"_ war is impossible but peace means surrender _\"sums up the sense of Arab impotence as the Israelis bulldoze their way through Arab objections and start work on more housing for Jews in a part of Jerusalem captured in 1967. The radical Arab fringe has jumped into the gap, trying to accelerate a trend back towards boycotting the Jewish state. \"_ Everyone looks very pessimistic. The situation looks very bad, _\"said Egyptian commentator Mohamed Sidahmed. \"_ The frame of reference for peace has openly collapsed. The parties concerned will try not to admit the breakdown but we are in a vicious circle where the forces of peace can_ not restore the process, _\"he told Reuters in a telephone interview. On the government side, Arab states are trying to coordinate a response to the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but their efforts so_far do not appear to have cut much ice with the Israeli government. In one little publicised gesture, the Arabs pulled out_of a steering committee meeting on multilateral talks, originally set for Moscow on March 20 and 21, an Egyptian official said. And on Sunday the Gulf Arab state of Oman said it had frozen ties with Israel over the Jewish state's settlement policies. Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Youssef bin Alawi bin Abdullah said his country could not expand relations with the Israeli government \"_ as long as it continues to violate peace agreements _\"signed with the Palestinians. An Islamic summit in Islamabad at the weekend urged member states to make relations with Israel conditional on Israeli compliance with its obligations to its Arab neighbours. The Egyptian official, defending the pace of government action, said the summit resolution was a step forward from a similar one passed at the Arab summit in Cairo last year. \"_ This time it was a direct call to freeze, _\"he said. But the resolution applies only to Islamic states which do not have peace treaties with Israel, in other words not those like Egypt and Jordan whose opinions should carry most weight. Sidahmed said the most dangerous aspect of the recent crises, firstly over the Jewish settlement and then over the repercussions of a suicide bomb in Tel Aviv, was that the Arab states had acquiesced in Washington calling all the shots. \"_ They are acting as_though they all agree that no one other than the United States should intervene, while Netanyahu is not condemned. This is encouraging the extremists at the expense of a peaceful solution, _\"he said. Forces in the Middle East hostile to the Israeli-Palestinian agreements have indeed taken courage from the crisis. \"_ The minimum effect we could say this move (the Israeli settlement) had is that it is making (Palestinian President Yasser) Arafat and the Egyptians revolutionary again, _\"said Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. \"_ It has been quite clear for many,_many years to us that from the beginning that Israel has never been interested in having peace, _\"he told a news conference in Islamabad. The militant Islamist group Hamas, the main opposition force on the ground, said it was time to finish off the peace process. \"_ We $... call upon our people and all Islamic, Palestinian, and Arab forces to deliver the coup_de_grace $... and to unite efforts in resisting the criminal plots of the enemy, _\"it said. Prominent Egyptian writer and commentator Mohamed Hassanein Haikal, a longstanding sceptic about the Middle East peace talks, said it was time Egypt reflected on the contradiction between opposing Israeli policies and allowing normal relations with the Jewish state to continue. An Arab diplomat based in Cairo agreed that the U.S. vetos raised questions about Washington's credibility as a sponsor of the peace talks. \"_ But I still believe the United States is capable of playing that role, _\"he added. \"_ The U.S. attitude just makes it much more difficult for us to work with our own constituency, _\"he said. \"_ We Arab states have a public opinion too and it is in an angry mood. _\"", "title": "EGYPT : Angry Arabs have few options against Israel, U.S..", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
