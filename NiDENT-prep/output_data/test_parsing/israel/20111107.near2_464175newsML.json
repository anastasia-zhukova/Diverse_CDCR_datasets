Daniel Sternoff JERUSALEM 1997-03-24 Palestinian rage over an Israeli settlement drive in Arab East Jerusalem limits Yasser Arafat's scope to clamp down on Islamist militants, Arab analysts said on Monday. Israel, reeling from a suicide bombing in a Tel Aviv cafe, has accused the Palestinian president of giving a \"_ green light _\" to militants to launch attacks on the Jewish state and has demanded a tough crackdown on Hamas and other Islamic groups. The Palestinian Authority denies it has encouraged attacks and says it will not be a puppet militia for Israel. \"_ It is difficult for the Palestinian Authority to take harsh measures against Hamas activists because these measures will not meet the same level of popular acceptance as they did a year ago, _\"Palestinian author and analyst Ziad Abu Amr told Reuters. Palestinian political winds have shifted since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent bulldozers to East Jerusalem last week to begin work on a Jewish settlement, a move that has set off daily clashes in the West Bank. The PLO wants East Jerusalem, captured along_with the rest of the West Bank by Israel in the 1967 Middle East, as capital of a Palestinian state. Israel views all of Jerusalem as its capital. \"_ The Palestinian Authority, through its peaceful diplomatic measures, can_ not stop Netanyahu from pursuing his settlement activities, _\"Abu Amr said. \"_ This opens the door for Palestinian factions to take things into their own hands $... because they believe that the Authority has lost its credibility and can_ not stand up against Israel. _\"Arafat last year jailed hundreds of Hamas militants and assaulted the group's grassroots network of schools, mosques, charities and social welfare organisations after a wave of Hamas suicide attacks killed 59 in Israel. Friday's bombing, the first in more than a year, killed three Israeli women. Arafat launched the crackdown last year while riding a wave of public optimism that his peace deals with Israel's previous Labour government were producing steady results. Only months earlier he had signed a deal to extend self-rule to West Bank cities and then won a landslide victory in the first Palestinian elections. The crackdown was also intended to boost embattled Israeli leader Shimon Peres ahead_of national elections last May. Peres was ousted by right-winger Netanyahu. Hamas calculates that a PLO internal crackdown now, while peace moves falter, would be seen as serving only Israeli interests. \"_ It is shameful for the Palestinian Authority to arrest Hamas members. If the Authority respects itself $... they should first of all ask Israel to stop building in the settlement, _\"Ghazi Hamad, editor of the Gaza-based Islamist weekly newspaper al-Risala, told Reuters. The Palestinian Authority, which blames Israel for current tensions, is reluctant to suppress militants it recently freed from prison. \"_ They (Israel) are wrong if they think that the Palestinian Authority is a copy of Antoine Lahd's forces in south Lebanon, _\"Palestinian Authority general secretary Ahmed Abdel-Rahman said, referring to the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia. Abu Amr said the Palestinian Authority would try to keep members of Hamas's military wing under control but predicted an all-out assault on Islamist social institutions would be ineffective. \"_ Militant groups have accumulated experience. They need three things : a man ready to sacrifice his life, a bomb, and a way to get to the place. It does_ n't need a big effort, _\" he said.", "title": "ISRAEL : Arafat's hands tied over militants $- analysts.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
