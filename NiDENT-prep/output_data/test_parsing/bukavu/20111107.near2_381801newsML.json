Arthur Malu-Malu KINSHASA 1996-02-18 Government warplanes pounded three rebel-held towns in eastern Zaire in a marked escalation of the war between the army and Tutsi-led guerrillas. \"_ Since this morning the FAZ (Zaire army) has been bombing Bukavu, Shabunda and Walikale, _\" a Defence Ministry statement said in the capital Kinshasa on Monday. The air war appeared designed as a psychological boost for President Mobutu Sese Seko's bedraggled army which has lost a vast stretch of borderland to Tutsi-led rebels since October. Zaire's ethnic Tutsis took up arms after local authorities tried to expel them to their ancestral homeland in Rwanda. By bombing Bukavu, the army symbolically took its much-vaunted but faltering counter-offensive to the starting position of the guerrilla campaign close to the Rwanda border. A senior Defence Ministry official said Goma, the biggest city in rebel hands, was next on the hit list. The attack on Walikale appeared to reinforce doubts over previous government claims of retaking the town from rebels. The senior official, who asked not to be named, said raids on Walikale were directed at \"_ pockets of resistance _\" . Defence officials also reported heavy ground battles around Amisi, 270 km (165 miles) south of Kisangani, the base of the government's mercenary-backed counter-offensive. They said the bombing sorties were being staged from Kisangani where Mobutu has stationed newly acquired Russian-made jet fighters and helicopter gunships. \"_ It is a surgical operation aimed at the enemy's strategic and military targets, _\" the Defence Ministry statement said of the bombings. It made no mention of casualties or damage. Civilians in the towns had been advised to move away from the targets to avoid being hit, it added. The medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF-Holland) said from the nearby city of Goma that at_least nine people were killed and up_to 37 wounded in the Bukavu bombing. Earlier Zaire dampened hopes for an early breakthrough by U.N. special peace envoy Mohammed Sahnoun, ruling out any ceasefire with rebels. \"_ The government stresses that it can_ not accept a ceasefire with unidentified belligerents, _\"Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda said in a statement issued as he met the veteran Algerian diplomat. The government accuses the rebels of waging a proxy war for Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda $-- which deny involvement. The statement implied Zaire could consider a truce with the neighbouring states. \"_ Any ceasefire with the regular armies of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi must be linked to the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Zaire, _\" the statement said. Zaire used the occasion of the U.N. mission to blame the world body for a threat by rebel leader Laurent Kabila to attack Tingi Tingi refugee camp near the city of Kisangani. It said a statement by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last week that Zaire was arming exiled Hutu hardliners among some 200,000 camp dwellers gave rebels the pretext to threaten a raid. U.N. officials said they saw Zairean military supplies being unloaded. \"_ The Zaire government demands that the Security Council remove from Zairean territory all Rwandan refugees _\" including ex-Rwandan soldiers and their militia allies, it added. The war in eastern Zaire is intertwined with the ethnic conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda. The Hutu army and civilian militias massacred up_to 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994 before fleeing en_masse into Zaire. Hutu hardliners in refugee camps in Zaire plotted revenge attacks on the Tutsi-led government that later took power in Rwanda, stoking tensions in the region.", "title": "ZAIRE : Zaire escalates war with rebels as U.N. mediates.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
