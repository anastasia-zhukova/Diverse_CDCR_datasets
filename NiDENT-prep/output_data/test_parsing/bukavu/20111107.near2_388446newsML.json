UNITED NATIONS 1997-02-19 U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Wednesday welcomed efforts by South African President Nelson Mandela to sponsor peace talks between Zaire's government and rebels holding territory in the east of the country, a U.N. spokesman said. \"_ The secretary-general welcomes the efforts of President Nelson Mandela and other regional leaders to bring together representatives of the Zairean government and the rebels from eastern Zaire, _\"U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said. \"_ At this point we have no details on who will be attending or when exactly the metting will take place, if in fact it does, _\" he said. Mandela said in Cape Town the initiative for the meeting had come jointly from the government of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko and from Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila and that, if arrangements went according_to plan, the two sides should arrive in South Africa on Thursday. Asked if Mandela's initiative was separate from one being pursued by Mohammed Sahnoun, joint special envoy of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), Eckhard said the crisis in Central Africa was receiving high-level attention from African leaders \"_ and my sense is they are working very closely together, among themselves and with us. _\"Referring to the elements of a peace plan drafted by Sahnoun and endorsed by the Security Council late on Tuesday, Eckhard said : \"_ Despite some negative comments by both sides in today's press, that is the framework that he (Sahnoun) thinks can be built upon and President Mandela is proceeding from that point forward. _\"The peace plan calls for an immediate cease-fire ; the withdrawal of all foreign forces, including mercenaries ; respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and other states in the region ; the protection of refugees and displaced persons ; and a peaceful settlement of the crisis through dialogue, elections and the convening of an international conference on peace, security and development. Eckhard disputed reports that more than one air raid had been carried out by the Zairean government against the rebel-held town of Bukavu. \"_ Our sources in Bukavu reconfirmed this morning that there were no_further bombing attacks on Bukavu after the initial one during which four bombs were dropped, I believe on Monday, _\" he said. \"_ Two wire services have been reporting bombing, deaths and injuries in Bukavu, but not out_of Bukavu. And our sources in Bukavu say there have been no bombing raids since Monday. _\"", "title": "UNITED NATIONS : Annan welcomes Zaire peace initiative by Mandela.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
