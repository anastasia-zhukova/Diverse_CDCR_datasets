Buchizya Mseteka NAIROBI 1997-02-17 At_least six people were killed and as many as 20 wounded when three Zairean government jets bombed the rebel-held east Zaire city of Bukavu on Monday, an eyewitness said. The eyewitness, an aid worker who declined to be identified, told Reuters by telephone from Bukavu that he counted the dead and wounded after the bombing. The aid worker said the bombs also dug holes three metres deep (10 feet) when they fell around Bukavu market and near the governors residence. \"_ Among the dead were a very young child about 14 months old and one woman, _\" he said. He said many Bukavu residents were fleeing the city with belongings on their heads, heading towards surrounding hills. Rebel radio broadcast appeals for calm. Aid workers and residents had initially reported little damage and no casualties in the first air strikes by the Kinshasa government. The bombing was the first government aerial activity confirmed by independent sources since rebels launched a military campaign last October and seized a large swath of territory in the vast central African nation. An aid worker speaking to Reuters by telephone from Bukavu said loud explosions echoed through Bukavu and panic-stricken residents were seen running for cover. \"_ Bukavu has just been bombed by two jet fighters. My staff and I are sheltering in the basement. We can see people running back_and_forth looking for shelter, _\" he said. Another aid worker, Marcel van Soest of the Medical Charity (Medecins sans Frontieres $- MSF), speaking by telephone from the rebel headquarters of Goma said his office in Bukavu reported the bombing lasted five minutes, just after 1400 GMT. He said three jets dropped several bombs in Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province, but he had no_further details. \"_ Several bombs, but we do not know how many (were dropped). Planes came from the west, bombing lasted five minutes, _\" he said. \"_ According to our representatives in Bukavu there were two confirmed wounded around the market area. There maybe were more but we do not have complete information, _\" he added. Earlier a businessman contacted by satellite telephone in Bukavu earlier told Reuters that three jets were involved in the bombing but said nobody had been hurt. He said there was general panic in the lakeside city with residents running in all directions. \"_ One bomb dropped near the governors residence, another fell in town but nobody was hurt. But there is general panic in Bukavu with people running in all directions, _\" said the businessman. Zaire's ailing president Mobutu Sese Seko has refused to negotiate with Laurent Kabilas rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire and instead has promised to hit back at the rebels. The central government in Kinshasa accuses Kabila of waging a proxy war for neighbouring Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. All three deny Zaires charges that their troops are involved. Ethnic Banyamulenge Tutsis launched the war after Zairean authorities denied them citizenship and planned to expel them to Rwanda, their ancestral home. They now hold towns and territory along the border with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. Rebel thrusts on several fronts have blunted a mercenary-backed counter-offensive the army launched on January 20.", "title": "KENYA : Zairean jets bomb rebel city killing six-witness.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
