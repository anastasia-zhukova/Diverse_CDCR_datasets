Arthur Malu-Malu KINSHASA 1997-02-18 Government planes bombed rebel-held towns in eastern Zaire again on Tuesday but guerrillas were fighting back in ground battles elsewhere, a defence ministry official said. \"_ Bombardments resumed this morning in all the three towns. We do_ n't have any assessment yet but we know that all the targets were hit, _\"the official told Reuters. Rebel leader Laurent Kabila said his forces would hit back at Zaire's military and commercial centre of Kisangani from where the attacks on Bukavu, Shabunda and Walikale were staged. \"_ These are terrorist actions. And we are going to get ready to take the war precisely to the place from where the bombers took off, _\"Kabila told French LCI television on Tuesday. His brief interview signalled a further escalation in the four-month war and looked certain to complicate U.N. efforts to prevent the conflict spiralling across a volatile region. The defence official scoffed at Kabila's threat but acknowledged that rebels were battling government troops on the ground around Amisi, 270 km (165 miles) south of Kisangani. \"_ Kabila threatens to go to Kisangani but he knows he ca_ n't. He has no planes for that and Kisangani is a fortress, _\"he said. \"_ Fighting is still going on around Amisi. Rebels are putting up a certain resistance. We ca_ n't use air strikes at Amisi because there are some refugees in the locality, _\"he added. Official goverment statements on Monday's air raids made no mention of casualties or damage. Aid workers in the area said at_least six people were killed in Bukavu. Military sources said eight were killed and scores wounded in Shabunda. The raid on Bukavu sent about 500 people fleeing for safety despite appeals on local radio for calm. A senior Zaire defence official said Goma, the biggest city in rebel hands, was next on the hit list. The bombing, a marked escalation of the war, appeared designed as a psychological boost for President Mobutu Sese Seko's bedraggled army which has lost a vast stretch of borderland to rebels since October. By bombing Bukavu, the army symbolically took its much-vaunted counter-offensive to the starting position of the guerrilla campaign close to the Rwanda border. Zaire's ethnic Tutsis took up arms after local authorities tried to expel them to their ancestral homeland in Rwanda. U.N. special envoy Mohammed Sahnoun was winding down his first visit to Zaire on Tuesday after what appeared to be difficult talks with government officials on ending the war. As he met officials on Monday, the foreign ministry issued a statement rejecting any truce with rebels. But it hinted a deal was possible with Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi whose armies Zaire accuses of joining the rebels. All three neighbours deny this. The war in eastern Zaire is intertwined with the ethnic conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda. The Hutu army and civilian militias massacred up_to 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994 before fleeing en_masse into Zaire. Hutu hardliners in refugee camps in Zaire plotted revenge attacks on the Tutsi-led government that later took power in Rwanda, stoking tensions in the region.", "title": "ZAIRE : Zaire says rebels bombed again, battles on ground.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
