Arthur Malu-Malu KINSHASA 1997-02-18 Zaire rained more bombs on its rebel-held towns on Tuesday, putting thousands of panic-stricken residents to flight, officials and aid workers said. A defence ministry official in Kinshasa said government planes bombed the eastern towns of Bukavu, Shabunda and Walikale on Tuesday, continuing attacks from Monday. \"_ Bombardments resumed this morning in all the three towns. We do_ n't have any assessment yet but we know that all the targets were hit, _\"the official told Reuters in the capital. \"_ There is a continuous flow of movement from Bukavu. It does not exceed perhaps 20 percent of the population but it is in the thousands, _\"said Marcel van Soest of the charity, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) in the eastern rebel headquarters city of Goma. \"_ People in panic are fleeing in all directions, _\"an aid worker in the Bukavu area said. Aid workers keeping track of bodies pulled from rubble put the latest death toll at 21, with 37 people wounded. The intensifying air war is the first tangible move in a faltering government counter-offensive to retake territory from rebels waging a four-month campaign in east Zaire. U.N. envoy Hohammed Sahnoun called for urgent steps to defuse violence and avert wider conflict in a volatile region. \"_ That implies the withdrawal of all foreign forces from east Zaire, including mercenaries, _\"Sahnoun told a news conference after talks with Zaire officials. European mercenaries, notably Serbs, are helping Zaire's bedraggled army to retake the initiative in the war after a string of losses at the hands of highly motivated rebels. Zaire's ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko hired mercenaries and acquired Russian-made fighter jets and helicopter gunships after accusing the armies of Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi of joining the rebels. All three neighbours deny this. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said on Tuesday that an expanding war in eastern Zaire was threatening humanitarian work and called for an end to the air raids. \"_ I hope this kind of attacks does not take place, _\"she told a news conference. She said relief work in the region, where UNHCR says up_to 400,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees are trapped amid fighting, would suffer as a result of increasing fighting. Rebel leader Laurent Kabila said his forces would hit back at Zaire's military and commercial centre of Kisangani from where the attacks on Bukavu, Shabunda and Walikale were staged. \"_ These are terrorist actions. And we are going to get ready to take the war precisely to the place from where the bombers took off, _\"Kabila told French LCI television on Tuesday. His brief interview signalled a further escalation in the four-month war and looked certain to complicate U.N. efforts to prevent the conflict spiralling across a volatile region. The defence official in Kinshasa scoffed at Kabila's threat but acknowledged that rebels were battling government troops on the ground around Amisi, 270 km (165 miles) south of Kisangani. \"_ Kabila threatens to go to Kisangani but he knows he ca_ n't. He has no planes for that and Kisangani is a fortress, _\"he said. Zaire's ethnic Tutsis took up arms after local authorities tried to expel them to their ancestral homeland in Rwanda. The war in eastern Zaire is intertwined with the ethnic conflict between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda. The Hutu army and civilian militias massacred up_to 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994 before fleeing en_masse into Zaire. Hutu hardliners in refugee camps in Zaire plotted revenge attacks on the Tutsi-led government that later took power in Rwanda, stoking tensions in the region.", "title": "ZAIRE : Zaire steps up air war, panic in rebel towns.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
