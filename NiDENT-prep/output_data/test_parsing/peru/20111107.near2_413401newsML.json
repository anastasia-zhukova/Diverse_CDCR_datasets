James Craig LIMA 1997-03-02 President Alberto Fujimori left Lima on Sunday for the Dominican Republic for talks on Peru's 75 $- day-old hostage crisis in Lima, but he played down rumours that he was seeking asylum for Marxist rebels. Fujimori flew out_of Lima's Group Eight air force base for a meeting with the Caribbean nation's President Leonel Fernandez that would include talks on the hostage crisis. He boarded the presidential plane for the five-hour flight to Santo Domingo without speaking to reporters. The flight had been delayed several hours without explanation. Travelling with the president were his son Kenji and six schoolmates as_well_as several government ministers and congressmen. He was seen off by government crisis negotiator Domingo Palermo. The one-day visit to Santo Domingo $-- Fujimori's second in less than a month $-- fuelled rumours he was negotiating an eventual asylum in the Dominican Republic for the 20-odd Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels holed up in the besieged Japanese ambassador's home. Fujimori has floated the idea of asylum for the rebels as part of a deal to free their 72 hostages. But late on Saturday, Fujimori was noncommittal when asked by local radio if the rebels would be given one-way tickets to the Caribbean island. \"_ It_'s a trip where we are going to work on the possibilities of boosting relations between both countries, and it does_ n't necessarily have to do with the possibility of asylum, _\" he said before leaving. \"_ However, (the hostage crisis) will be discussed, _\" he added, giving no_further details. Fujimori met the Dominican president on Feb. 5 during a four-hour stopover at Santo Domingo airport, but the Peruvian embassy there denied they had discussed offering refuge to the rebels. Fujimori was leaving Peru amid controversy, as the Argentine human rights group Mothers of Plaza de Mayo lashed out at him for spurning their offer to mediate in the hostage crisis. They accused Fujimori of torture and oppression. The Mothers sent a delegation headed by their president, Hebe de Bonafini, to Peru hoping to meet Fujimori and visit the besieged residence, but announced they were giving up and going back to Argentina on Sunday after a week of being repeatedly snubbed. The delegation, whose members wear white scarves on their heads, also received a hostile reception from the Peruvian media, which accused them of naivity for accepting a guerrilla invitation to mediate. The Vatican, the Canadian government and the Red Cross are mediating in the talks to end the hostage crisis. In a letter to Fujimori obtained by Reuters, the Mothers accused the president of setting out to humiliate them and of sending police and soldiers in disguise to harass them. The Mothers accused Fujimori of heading a \"_ virtual military dictatorship, _\" using torture and holding 5,500 political prisoners. Peru has more than 3,000 people behind bars for \"_ terrorism. _\"The government admits that about 300 may be innocent and is examining their cases, but human rights groups say the number could be as high as 1,000. In Tokyo, the Japanese television network TV Asahi said Peru has decided not to press charges against one of its reporter and his interpreter for making an unauthorised entry into the diplomatic residence. The Peruvian authorities had been considering charges of terrorism and treason against Tsuyoshi Hitomi, 27, a New York $- based reporter for the commercial network, but decided there was no evidence of such activities. Fujimori repeatedly ruled out considering the MRTA's main demand for the release of their jailed comrades but has indicated he might make other concessions. The rebels originally took hundreds of hostages when they stormed the residence on Dec. 17, but let most of them go early in the crisis. They have held onto their most powerful bargaining chips, including Fujimori's younger brother, two government ministers, the envoys of Japan and Bolivia, as_well_as two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats.", "title": "PERU : Peru's Fujimori leaves on snap hostage crisis trip.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
