LIMA 1997-02-17 The son of a Peruvian judge held hostage in the Japanese ambassador's home passed his birthday on Monday without seeing his dad but with a message of solidarity from Japan's prime minister. \"_ Dear Huguito : I received with emotion your letter and understand perfectly what you are feeling because I am a son and am now a father of my own children, _\"Ryutaro Hashimoto wrote in a letter to 12-year-old Hugo Sivina. \"_ I know the pain that you are feeling and ask you to pray a lot and have faith that better days are ahead, _\" he added in the letter, which was read on local radio. Hugo's father, Peruvian Supreme Court Judge Hugo Sivina, is among 72 hostages held by Marxist rebels in what has become the longest hostage siege in Latin American history. The boy wrote in early February to government negotiator Domingo Palermo, Peru's President Alberto Fujimori, Hashimoto and God, asking that \"_ someone hear me and make them give back my father. _\"Speaking on Radioprogramas del Peru, the younger Hugo Sivina sent his father a greeting. \"_ I_ 'm fine and very strong and despite the long distance between us I send you a strong hug, _\" he said, choking back tears. His mother Luisa Sivina also sent her love on the airwaves. \"_ I just want to say to my husband Hugo that Huguito is fine, serene, just like you showed him how to be, and that on this day we are all going to be together like always, _\" she said. Among those held by Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement rebels are two Peruvian ministers, the ambassadors of Japan and Bolivia, two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats and Fujimori's brother Pedro.", "title": "PERU : Japan's Hashimoto writes to Peru hostage's son.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
