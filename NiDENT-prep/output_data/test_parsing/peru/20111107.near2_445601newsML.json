Roger Atwood LIMA 1997-03-16 Talks to end Peru's three-month hostage standoff appeared to be moving forward again on Sunday after two neutral mediators met with the Marxist rebels holding 72 people at the Japanese ambassador's home. Members of an independent guarantors' commision, Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani and Canadian ambassador Anthony Vincent, met the hostage-takers inside the besieged residence for about 90 minutes Saturday. They had no comment for reporters later. The meeting, the latest in a flurry of contacts with the rebels over the past five days, added to signs that talks are advancing again after breaking off a week ago over mutual charges of bad faith by the government and rebels. A top Japanese foreign ministry official was due_to arrive in Lima on Monday or Tuesday and then fly on to Cuba and the Dominican Republic to discuss chances for asylum for some of the rebels in those nations if they want it, a Japanese official said in Tokyo on Friday. President Alberto Fujimori, grappling with the most serious challenge to his authority since taking office in 1990, went last month to Cuba to arrange asylum for the MRTA hostage-takers in talks with Fidel Castro. Talks occurred ironically at a time of rising tension around the besieged house, where the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels are demanding freedom for about 450 comrades from jail in exchange for release of the hostages. Police, who have surrounded the home since the rebels took over on Dec. 17, closed off a nearby street to reporters in another gradual move to push back the media from the mined and booby-trapped residence. They also erected barrels filled with sand near other media lookouts. Police gave no explanation for the barrels but they seemed intended to act as some kind of barrier. On Saturday, armed men calling themselves MRTA rebels burst into a Lima textile factory, tied up the employees and then tossed grenades into the plant, sparking a huge fire. Eight people were injured in the fire. Police initially said the attack was the work of MRTA but later said they were_ n't so sure, suggesting it may have been the work of common criminals trying to pass themselves off as guerrillas. \"_ This act is under investigation and we can_ not confirm anything about it. We_ 'll have some word later on who caused this explosion, _\" said a police spokesman. The owner of the factory in Lima's La Victoria district said he thought the attackers came to kidnap him and that he had not received any warnings or demands for money from MRTA before the attack. Common criminals in Peru have often been known to pass themselves off as guerrillas when committing crimes in an effort to throw police off their trail. Fujimori received a welcome statement of support from French President Jacques Chirac, who was visiting neighbouring Bolivia on Saturday. \"_ Like any civilised and democratic individual, I am totally shocked by this event, _\"Chirac told a news conference in La Paz. \"_ I stand with the Peruvian government at this difficult moment. _\"Fujimori cancelled his own visit to Bolivia but denied it was due_to the hostage crisis, saying instead Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada had scheduling problems. Two of the roughly 400 guerrillas whose freedom is being demanded by MRTA are in Bolivian prisons. In a sign that tension was nearing the breaking point inside the residence, Bolivian ambassador and hostage Jorge Gumucio got into an argument with one of the guerrillas which ended only when other hostages intervened, Fujimori said. \"_ Ambassador Gumucio suffered abuse. The ambassador himself and a group of hostages reacted very energetically and only then was this unfortunate incident brought under control, _\"Fujimori told reporters. \"_ It was basically verbal abuse, _\" said Fujimori. Bolivian officials said the argument began when one of the rebels made disparaging, \"_ offensive _\" remarks about Bolivia and that the rebel shook his gun in Gumucio's face.", "title": "PERU : Rebels, mediators meet again in Peru standoff.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
