Saul Hudson LIMA 1997-03-02 President Alberto Fujimori was set to head to the Dominican Republic early on Sunday for talks on the 75-day-old hostage crisis in Lima, but he played down speculation that he was seeking asylum for Peru's Marxist rebels. Fujimori was expected to fly out_of Lima just before dawn for a meeting with the Caribbean republic's President Leonel Fernandez that would include talks on the hostage crisis. Government Palace officials had said Fujimori would leave Lima soon after midnight local time (0500 GMT), but his trip was delayed without explanation. The one-day visit to Santo Domingo $-- Fujimori's second in less than a month $-- fuelled rumours he was negotiating an eventual asylum in the Dominican Republic for the 20-odd Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels holed up in the besieged Japanese ambassador's home. Fujimori has floated the idea of asylum for the rebels as part of a deal to free their 72 hostages. But late on Saturday, Fujimori was noncommittal when asked by local radio if the rebels would be given one-way tickets to the Caribbean island. \"_ It_'s a trip where we are going to work on the possibilities of boosting relations between both countries, and it does_ n't necessarily have to do with the possibility of asylum, _\"he said before leaving. \"_ However, (the hostage crisis) will be discussed, _\"he added, giving no_further details. Fujimori met the Dominican president on Feb. 5 during a four-hour stopover at Santo Domingo airport, but the Peruvian embassy there denied they had discussed offering refuge to the rebels. Fujimori was leaving Peru amid controversy, as the Argentine human rights group Mothers of Plaza de Mayo lashed out at him for spurning their offer to mediate in the hostage crisis. They accused Fujimori of torture and oppression. The Mothers sent a delegation headed by their president, Hebe de Bonafini, to Peru hoping to meet Fujimori and visit the besieged residence, but announced they were giving up and going back to Argentina on Sunday after a week of being repeatedly snubbed. The delegation, whose members wear white scarves on their heads, also received a hostile reception from the Peruvian media, which accused them of naivity for accepting a guerrilla invitation to mediate. The Vatican, the Canadian government and the Red Cross are mediating in the talks to end the hostage crisis. In a letter to Fujimori obtained by Reuters, the Mothers accused the president of setting out to humiliate them and of sending police and soldiers in disguise to harass them. The Mothers accused Fujimori of heading a \"_ virtual military dictatorship, _\"using torture and holding 5,500 political prisoners. Peru has more than 3,000 people behind bars for \"_ terrorism. _\"The government admits that about 300 may be innocent and is examining their cases, but human rights groups say the number could be as high as 1,000. In Tokyo, Kyodo news reported that Peru's public prosecutors have decided not to indict a Japanese television reporter and his Peruvian interpreter who made an unauthorised entry into the Japanese ambassador's residence. Police had investigated Tsuyoshi Hitomi, a 27-year-old New York correspondent of the commercial TV Asahi network, and his interpreter on suspicion of supporting terrorism and committing treason. The report could not immediately be confirmed. Fujimori has repeatedly ruled out considering the MRTA's main demand for the release of their jailed comrades but has indicated he might make other concessions. The rebels originally took hundreds of hostages when they stormed the residence on Dec. 17, but let most of them go early in the crisis. They have held onto their most powerful bargaining chips, including Fujimori's younger brother, two government ministers, the envoys of Japan and Bolivia, as_well_as two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats.", "title": "PERU : Peru's Fujimori makes lightning trip to discuss siege.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
