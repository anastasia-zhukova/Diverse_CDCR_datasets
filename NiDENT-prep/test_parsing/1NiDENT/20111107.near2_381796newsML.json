Corinne Dufka NAIROBI 1997-02-17 Three Zairean jet fighters bombed the rebel-held east Zairean city of Bukavu on Monday but caused little damage, aid workers and residents said. The bombing was the first government aerial activity confirmed by independent sources since rebels launched a military campaign last October and seized a large swath of territory in the vast central African nation. An aid worker speaking to Reuters by telephone from Bukavu said loud explosions echoed through Bukavu and panic-stricken residents were seen running for cover. \"_ Bukavu has just been bombed by two jet fighters. My staff and I are sheltering in the basement. We can see people running back_and_forth looking for shelter, _\"he said. Another aid worker, Marcel van Soest of the Medical Charity (Medecins sans Frontieres $- MSF), speaking by telephone from the rebel headquarters of Goma said his office in Bukavu reported the bombing lasted five minutes, just after 1400 GMT. He said three jets dropped several bombs in Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province, but he had no_further details. \"_ Several bombs, but we do not know how many (were dropped). Planes came from the west, bombing lasted five minutes, _\"he said. A businessman contacted by satellite telephone in Bukavu also told Reuters that three jets were involved in the bombing but said nobody had been hurt. He said there was general panic in the lakeside city with residents running in all directions. \"_ One bomb dropped near the governor's residence, another fell in town but nobody was hurt. But there is general panic in Bukavu with people running in all directions, _\"said the businessman. Zaire's ailing president Mobutu Sese Seko has refused to negotiate with Laurent Kabila's rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire and instead promised to hit back at the rebels. The central government in Kinshasa accuses Kabila of waging a proxy war for neighbouring Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. All three deny Zaire's charges that their troops are involved. Ethnic Banyamulenge Tutsis launched the war after Zairean authorities denied them citizenship and planned to expel them to Rwanda, their ancestral home. They now hold towns and territory along the border with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. Rebel thrusts on several fronts have blunted a mercenary-backed counter-offensive the army launched on January 20. The military says it is reinforcing Zaire's third city of Kisangani and Buta to the north and Kindu to the south. Rebel leader Kabila has given Mobutu, who spent much of last year in France recovering from prostate surgery, until February 21 to begin talks on stepping down.", "title": "KENYA : Zairean jets bomb rebel-held city.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
