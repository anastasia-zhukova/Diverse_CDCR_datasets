KINSHASA 1997-02-19 Zaire's Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said on Wednesday that he had not been not informed of any imminent meeting in South Africa between representatives of President Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila. South African President Nelson Mandela said earlier on Wednesday in Cape Town that an emissary of Mobutu would hold talks with Kabila on how to end the war in eastern Zaire. The rebels have taken a portion of the vast central African state's territory along the border with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. Zaire has repeatedly said that it will recapture rebel-held towns and has ruled out any negotiation with Kabila, who it sees as a puppet of neighbouring Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. \"_ Until now, I am completely unaware that President Mobutu may have sent any emissary to meet Mr Kabila, _\"Kengo told journalists. \"_ I ca_ n't say anything. I know nothing about it. _' Foreign Minister Kawanda wa Kawanda earlier told Reuters that he had not been informed of any such meeting. \"_ I do not know of this meeting. All I know is that there is no contact between the president and the rebel chief, _\"Kawanda said. A senior Defence Ministry official said there had been no significant developments on the war front on Wednesday, 48 hours after Zairean military planes bombed the rebel-held town of Bukavu, killing at_least 19 people. Kamanda, who was unhappy with a U.N. Security Council resolution passed on Tuesday calling for a truce, said Zaire would continue to fight in self-defence. The Zairean government has accused the armies of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda of fighting alongside the rebels. The three countries have dismissed the accusations as groundless. The Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim, and the foreign ministers of South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Tanzania met Kamanda in Kinshasa on Wednesday. The OAU chief and the ministers are due_to leave Zaire on Thursday.", "title": "ZAIRE : Zaire PM says unaware of meeting in South Africa.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
