LONDON 1997-02-08 Tajikistan's Security Minister Saidamir Zukhurov has been taken hostage by rebels holding a group of U.N. workers in the former Soviet republic, Itar-Tass news agency reported on Saturday. The Russian agency, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, quoted Tajik presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov as saying Zukhurov was seized when he went to the rebels' base camp on Friday for talks on the release of the U.N. personnel. No other details were immediately available. The United Nations issued a statement in the Tajik capital Dushanbe on Friday saying it was withdrawing all non-essential personnel from the Central Asian state after a spate of kidnappings. \"_ In view of the serious security situation in Dushanbe and danger to the lives of United Nations personnel, United Nations special representative Gerd Merrem $... has decided to relocate UNMOT (military observers) and all other U.N. agencies from Tajikistan to Uzbekistan, _\"the statement said. Only essential personnel would remain, it said. On Thursday, the Red Cross announced it was suspending operations in Tajikistan after two employees, Elizabeth Trinch of Britain and her Tajik translator, were abducted. They were released on Friday and returned to Dushanbe. But four employees with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), including a Nigerian, four U.N. military observers from Austria, Switzerland and Ukraine, and four Russian reporters kidnapped earlier this week were still held by the rebels. The hostage-takers are part of a group commanded by Rizvon Sadirov, who previously fought for the Islamic opposition forces but whose loyalties are now unclear. The kidnappings were carried out by Rizvon's brother Bakhrom Sadirov, who is demanding free passage for rebels based in neighbouring Afghanistan to return to Tajikistan. Tajikistan, a mountainous country bordering China, has been racked by a four-year civil war but a ceasefire between the government and the armed Islamic opposition last December appears to be holding.", "title": "UK : Tajik security minister seized by rebels $- Tass.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
