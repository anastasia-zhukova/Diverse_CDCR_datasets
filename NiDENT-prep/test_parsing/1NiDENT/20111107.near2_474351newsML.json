Daniel Sternoff JERUSALEM 1996-03-29 A U.S. presidential envoy appealed for calm after finding Israelis and Palestinians in no mood for compromise during an emergency mission to salvage crumbling Middle East peace moves. The White House called mediator Dennis Ross' two-day emergency shuttle \"_ constructive _\"but said more work was needed as Israelis and Palestinians hardened their positions in a deepening peace crisis and the West Bank seethed with unrest. Ross headed back to Washington on Friday without scoring a breakthrough after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in Rabat, Morocco. Netanyahu said after meeting Ross that only a sustained Palestinian crackdown on \"_ terrorism _\"$-- not just a pledge to fight militants $-- would salvage peacemaking. \"_ We want immediate action $... if the Palestinian side meets its commitments $-- again not for just a day or two $-- but if we see a basic change during the coming period, we will be able to put the peace process back on course, _\"Netanyahu said. But the PLO insisted the only way out_of the crisis was for Israel to order its bulldozers to stop ripping up an Arab East Jerusalem hillside to build a new Jewish settlement. \"_ The blackmail attempt of Netanyahu is only a cloud of smoke but the roots of the crisis still exist which is settlement, _\"Palestinian cabinet secretary Ahmad Abd al-Rahman told Reuters. Arafat was due_to convene his cabinet in self-ruled Gaza on Saturday after wrapping up an Asian and African tour in Egypt. He returns as thousands of Israeli police, backed by tanks and helicopters, remained on high alert ahead_of warnings of a potential surge of unrest peaking on Sunday $-- the annual \"_ Land Day _\"when Israeli Arabs stage protests against government confiscation of lands. In Hebron on Friday, Israeli soldiers dispersed scores of Palestinian stone-throwers in the ninth straight day of West Bank clashes. Palestinian police helped restrain the protesters. On Jerusalem's Temple Mount, stone-throwers pelted Israeli police after Moslem Friday prayers at al-Aqsa mosque. Ross said he would report back to U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright before deciding how to tackle the crisis. Israeli-PLO talks have been frozen since Netanyahu broke ground last week for the settlement on a hilltop called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic, unleashing Palestinian rage in daily West Bank unrest. The crisis deepened last Friday, when an Islamist suicide bomber killed three Israeli women at a Tel Aviv cafe. Israel has accused Arafat of giving a tacit \"_ green light _\"for militant attacks. The PLO denies the charge. \"_ If there is going to be a way to find the means and the best methods for moving forward, we have to find an environment of calm and we can_ not see a continuation of terror and violence, _\"Ross told reporters. Netanyahu demanded Arafat arrest militants, dismantle guerrilla groups and tighten cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. He denied Ross asked Israel to make any reciprocal gesture. Abd al-Rahman blasted the United States for not pressing Israel to halt its settlement construction and for vetoing U.N. resolutions censuring the Jewish state's housing plan. \"_ As long as the United States contradicts international legitimacy, there will be a big question as_to the American role in the Middle East and it will weaken its credibility, _\"he said.", "title": "ISRAEL : US envoy calls for calm but Mideast crisis deep.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
