BEIJING 1997-03-10 A hijacked Taiwan airliner landed safely at an airport in China's southeastern city of Xiamen on Monday, an airport official said. \"_ It just landed, _\"said the official. \"_ It came down safely. _\"Far Eastern flight 128, a Boeing 757 with a capacity of 201 passengers, left from Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung on a scheduled flight to Taipei when it changed course and headed towards the Chinese communist mainland, officials said. It was not immediately known how many passengers and crew were aboard. Aviation sources contacted by Reuters in Taiwan said a lone hijacker, said to be a journalist, doused himself with gasoline and ordered the pilot to fly to the port city of Xiamen in Fujian province. The motive for the hijacking was not immediately known. In Taiwan, Defence Minister Chiang Chung-ling had confirmed to parliament in an emergency briefing that the hijacker had brandished an inflammable liquid and ordered the plane to China. Four Taiwan fighters had scrambled into an escort formation, he said. Taiwan defence officials took a decision not to intercept the flight so_as_not_to incite a military \"_ misunderstanding _\"with arch rival China's People's Liberation Army, a defence official told Reuters by telephone. The last hijacking of a Taiwanese airliner to China was in May 1986, when the pilot of a Boeing 747 cargo plane owned by Taiwan's flag carrier China Airlines commandeered the jet and flew it to Guangzhou. Beijing returned the plane and two crew members who did not want to stay in China after talks between the two rivals in Hong Kong. It was unclear how Beijing would deal with the latest hijacker. Taiwan has banned direct air links with China since 1949, when the communists defeated the Nationalists and drove them into exile on the island. China endured a rash of 12 hijackings in 1993 and 1994 by Chinese who ordered pilots to fly them to the Nationalist-ruled Taiwan for political asylum. Air piracy fell off sharply after Beijing launched a major drive to improve what had been lax security at most airports.", "title": "CHINA : Hijacked Taiwan jet lands at China's Xiamen.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
