Gerald Akilimani GOMA, Zaire 1997-02-18 Thousands of residents fled the eastern Zairean city of Bukavu on Tuesday in panic after at_least 21 people were killed in raids by government warplanes on three rebel-held centres. Aid workers reported that panic-stricken residents carrying a_few belongings fled on Tuesday for safer areas outside the city following at_least 500 who had left on Monday. \"_ There is a continuous flow of movement from Bukavu. It does not exceed perhaps 20 percent of the population but it is in the thousands, _\"said Marcel van Soest, the head of Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) in the eastern rebel headquarters city of Goma. \"_ People in panic are fleeing in all directions, _\"another aid worker said. They fled despite appeals on rebel-run radio for calm. Zairean government radio has told people to leave rebel centres. Van Soest told Reuters by telephone his staff in Bukavu reported the discovery on Tuesday of four bodies buried in the rubble from Monday's air raids, taking the toll to 13 dead and 37 wounded. Nine dead and 37 wounded had been taken on Monday to the Bukavu Central Hospital, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. Hospital sources said they were all civilians. Military sources in the region meanwhile told Reuters eight people were killed and scores were wounded in another raid by Zairean government planes on Monday on the town of Shabunda. A Zairean defence ministry official said in Kinshasa planes bombed bombed rebel-held Bukavu, Shabunda and Walikale towns again on Tuesday morning and all the targets had been hit. But aid workers in contact with Bukavu by radio said no new raids had been reported on Bukavu by about 2 p.m. (1200 GMT). Van Soest said 20 people were lightly wounded in the lakeside city and other 17 were badly hurt. A foreign aid worker said among the dead were a 14-month-old child and a woman. He said bombs gouged holes three metres (10 feet) deep in the main market and near the governor's residence, where rebel leader Laurent Kabila has stayed but he was not there on Monday. Other aid workers said four planes, believed to be MiG-21s, dropped four bombs on Bukavu on Monday. One exploded near the border with Rwanda and another crashed into a junction in the town centre. A senior Zairean defence ministry official said on Monday that Goma, the first main centre seized by the rebels who launched their revolt in October, was the next on the hit list. \"_ Goma is quiet today. The population is very alert but there is no panic and not too much worry, _\"said Van Soest. \"_ The old leopard can bite, _\"added a civil servant in Goma, referring to ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko who has vowed to defeat the rebellion threatening to tear apart Africas third largest country. There was no word on casualties in Walikale, where the senior Zairean defence official said the air raids were directed at \"_ pockets of resistance _\". The government has said its troops retook the town from rebels, who say it remains in their hands. Mondays was the first air raid confirmed independently since rebels seized swath of eastern Zaire at_least 1,000 km (600 miles) long bordering on Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania. The air raid took a government counter-offensive, which had been faltering, symbolically to the heart of the revolt but military analysts said Kinshasa had few other ways to hit back. Kabila threatened on Tuesday to attack the government's base at Kisangani city, from where the planes took off on Monday. \"_ These are terrorist actions. And we are going to get ready to take the war precisely to the place from where the bombers took off, _\"Kabila said in an interview on French LCI television.", "title": "ZAIRE : Thousands flee east Zaire air raids, 21 dead.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
