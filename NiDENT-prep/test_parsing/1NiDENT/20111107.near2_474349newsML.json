Daniel Sternoff JERUSALEM 1997-03-28 A U.S. presidential envoy headed for home on Friday without scoring a breakthrough during an emergency Middle East mission to salvage crumbling Israeli-PLO peace talks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after talks with veteran mediator Dennis Ross in Jerusalem that only a Palestinian crackdown on \"_ terrorism _\"$-- not just a pledge to fight militants $-- would salvage peacemaking. \"_ We want immediate action, _\"Netanyahu said. \"_ If the Palestinian side meets its commitments $-- again not for just a day or two $-- but if we see a basic change during the coming period, we will be able to put the peace process back on course. _\"But the PLO insisted the only way out_of the crisis was for Israel to order its bulldozers to stop ripping up an Arab East Jerusalem hillside to build a new Jewish settlement. \"_ These things $... call for a quick Palestinian, Arab and Moslem move to face these dangerous developments not only against Jerusalem but also against the Palestinian people, _\"Palestinian President Yasser Arafat told reporters in Tunis after talks with Tunisian President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. Ross left for Washington after his two-day shuttle between Netanyahu in Israel and Arafat in the Moroccan capital Rabat, saying only that he would report back to U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. \"_ They will want to consider the report before deciding what are the most appropriate next steps that might be taken, _\"Ross told reporters after meeting Netanyahu. \"_ One thing that_'s clear as I leave is that it_'s essential to re-establish calm, _\"Ross said. Israeli-PLO talks have been frozen since Netanyahu broke ground last week for the settlement on a hilltop called Har Homa in Hebrew and Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic, unleashing Palestinian rage in daily West Bank unrest. Arabs view East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied in 1967 and annexed, as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The crisis deepened last Friday, when an Islamist suicide bomber killed three Israeli women at a Tel Aviv cafe. Israel has accused Arafat of giving a tacit \"_ green light _\"for militant attacks. The PLO denies the charge. In Hebron, Israeli soldiers dispersed scores of Palestinian stone-throwers. Witnesses said 25 protesters arrived at hospital with rubber bullet wounds and two with wounds from live ammunition. Palestinian police helped contain the riots. On Jerusalem's Temple Mount, stone-throwers pelted Israeli police after Moslem Friday prayers at al-Aqsa mosque. Police held their fire while guards from the independent Islamic Trust helped to disperse the protesters. Netanyahu said that Arafat had assured Ross in Rabat that \"_ terrorism _\"would stop. \"_ But what we_ 're interested in right_now are not verbal assurances in Rabat but action $-- actually deeds and words here $-- because this is where the terrorism is exploding, _\"he said. The Israeli leader demanded Arafat arrest militants, dismantle guerrilla groups and tighten cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. In Tunis, Arafat's spokesman Marwan Kanafani shrugged off reports that the Palestinian leader had made a new pledge to stop violence when he met Ross. \"_ The president did_ n't charge Ross with a new position regarding violence because the president's and Palestinian Authority's stand is clear on this issue, _\"Kanafani said. Arafat left Tunis for Cairo and was due_to return to self-ruled Gaza on Saturday. Friday's violence overshadowed Easter celebrations on Good Friday at the traditional site of Jesus's crucifixion in Jerusalem.", "title": "ISRAEL : US envoy comes up short in Mideast crisis mission.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
