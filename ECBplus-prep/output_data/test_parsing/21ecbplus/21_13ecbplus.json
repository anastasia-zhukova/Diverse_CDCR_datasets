Raj K. Chohan was walking alongside parked cars on 117th Street and 97th Avenue at about 7 p. m. when she was struck by a gray 2013 Toyota Camry, which then sped off, according to cops. \u201c The husband and wife came to visit, \u201d said South Richmond Hill resident Suri Charanjit. \u201c He was with her when it happened. \u201d Charanjit said he and his family came out of their home on 117th Street and saw a crowd of people gathered and EMS performing CPR on Chohan. Emergency responders were called in and took Chohan to Jamaica Hospital, where she was later pronounced dead, the NYPD said. Residents along 117th Street said a police cruiser happened to be pulled over on the side of the road near where the crash occurred, and immediately chased the vehicle. Police said the officers caught up with 23 - year - old Vishwanand Subryan of Schenectady a few blocks away - at 115th Street and 101st Avenue - where he was taken into custody without incident. Subryan was charged with vehicular manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death and DWI, the NYPD said. Chohan, who is a mother to a married son and daughter, had been in her former neighborhood to visit Piara Singh, according to Charanjit who translated for Singh. She had moved about a mile and a half away five or six years ago, her friend said. As part of a Sikh tradition, she had been visiting to greet Singh \u2019 s daughter - in - law, who recently arrived from India, and present her with gifts, he explained. Chohan had called Singh \u2019 s house to let the family know she was outside and asked that someone open the door. \u201c When [Singh \u2019 s] son came out, he saw her on the floor, \u201d Charanjit said. Both Charanjit and Singh complained cars speeding along 117th Street. \u201c The cars come straight from 103rd Avenue. They have no stop sign, no bump, nothing but green until 95th Avenue, \u201d Charanjit said. \u201c This is just a side street. We want to have a stop sign. \u201d", "title": "Man charged with DWI, leaving scene after S.
