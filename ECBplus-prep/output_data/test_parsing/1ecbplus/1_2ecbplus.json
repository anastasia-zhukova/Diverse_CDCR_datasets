Mark Jay Heller told a judge that Lohan was settling in at Morningside Recovery, a treatment facility in Newport Beach. \"My client is ensconced in the bosom of that facility right now, \"Heller argued after a prosecutor objected to Lohan's choice of rehab facilities. \"She's in rehab right now. Nothing bad is going to happen. \" TMZ reported Lohan was shopping at an electronics store while her attorney was in court, and that she never entered Morningside. White said he was \"completely blindsided\" by Lohan's placement at Morningside because Heller had previously agreed to send the actress to a different facility that had been vetted.", "title": "Lawyer : Lindsay Lohan checks into rehab facility.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / www. cbsnews.com / 8301 - 207 _ 162 - 57582560 / lawyer - lindsay - lohan - checks - into - rehab - facility /"}
