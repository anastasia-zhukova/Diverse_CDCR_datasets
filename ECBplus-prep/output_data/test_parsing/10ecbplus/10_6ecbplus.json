I can \u2019 t. Yet it \u2019 s coming from up top. Red Sox owner John Henry has said, in so many words, that his team will not sign Mark Teixeira. His exact words : \u201c We met with Mr. Teixeira and were very much impressed with him. After hearing about his other offers, however, it seems clear that we are not going to be a factor. \u201d You can follow the entire saga on MLB Trade Rumors. No one expected this, at least not this soon. The Red Sox, the team so many considered the frontrunners for Teixeira, will, in the words of the owner himself, not be factors. It appears, from Henry \u2019 s words, the price tag is a bit too high. Reports of the Red Sox offer varied, though WCVB - TV claims it was eight years and $184 million, or a $23 million average annual value. Boston could obviously jump back into the picture, but for now it appears they \u2019 ll let the first baseman sign elsewhere. Clearly, I expect a flurry of \u201c now the Yankees have to get him \u201d comments. Think about this, though. There \u2019 s at least one offer out there better than eight years and $184 million.
