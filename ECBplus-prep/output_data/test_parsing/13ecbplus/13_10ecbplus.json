The building dates to 1935, when the original Matanuska Valley colonists settled in Alaska, and has been on the Alaska Association For Historic Preservation \u2019 s list of endangered historic properties for several years. Judi Bittner, the state \u2019 s historic preservation official, says the destruction of the building represents a big loss to the state \u2019 s history and to the people of Palmer. The property was in private ownership by Anchorage attorney William Ingaldson. Palmer Public Safety Director Jon Owen said Tuesday that the city had not purchased the property, although there were plans to do so. \u201c The building was uninsured, \u201d Owen said. The Anchorage Daily News reports the value of the building at $380, 600.
