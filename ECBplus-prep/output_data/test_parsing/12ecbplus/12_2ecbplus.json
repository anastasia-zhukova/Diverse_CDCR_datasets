A statement from the Defence PRO says the incident happened yesterday when INS Sukanya was escorting a group of merchant vessels. Five pirate boats tried to attack these vessels but were challenged by the Indian Naval ship. After a brief skirmish, two of them managed to flee the area but three boats were captured by INS Sukanya, the statement said. The three boats had a total of 26 Somali crew onboard. During the operation, six AK - 47 rifles, 12 magazines and about 300 rounds of ammunition were found and confiscated. The operation holds significance as over a hundred billion dollars of India's external trade passes each year through this busy sea lane. This is the fifth successful anti - piracy operation conducted by INS Sukanya, in the course of her ongoing patrol mission in the Gulf of Aden, which commenced in September.", "title": "Indian ship thwarts piracy attempt in Gulf of Aden, 26 pirates arrested.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / www. ndtv.com / article / india / indian - ship - thwarts - piracy - attempt - in - gulf - of - aden - 26 - pirates - arrested - 148985"}
