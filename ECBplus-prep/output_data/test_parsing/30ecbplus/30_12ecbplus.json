According to an MWEB update - \"Some more bandwidth was brought online last night [10 October 2011] bringing us up to 83% of our required capacity. We allowed P2P traffic to run from midnight to 7am, after which it had to give way for critical traffic again. \" As MWEB also uses PeerApp's caching solution, it may help serve some P2P traffic without accessing the undersea cable.", "title": "South Africa : P2P Control Helps Overcome Undersea Cable Outage.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / broabandtrafficmanagement. blogspot. nl / 2011 / 10 / south - africa - p2p - control - helps - overcome. html"}
