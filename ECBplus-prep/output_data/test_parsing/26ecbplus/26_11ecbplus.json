The head of the Genovese crime family, who had suffered from heart disease, died at the federal prison in Springfield, Mo., said prison spokesman Al Quintero. It was the same place where rival mob boss John Gotti died of cancer in 2002 at age 61. Gigante's death also was confirmed by Christine Monaco, a spokeswoman for the FBI, the organization that worked for years to put him behind bars. Dubbed the \"Oddfather\" for his bizarre behavior, Gigante had scored a lengthy string of victories over prosecutors, but it ended with a July 1997 racketeering conviction. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.", "title": "Mob boss 'Oddfather' dies in prison at 77.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / www. deseretnews.com / article / 635170067 / Mob - boss - Oddfather - dies - in - prison - at - 77. html? pg=all"}
