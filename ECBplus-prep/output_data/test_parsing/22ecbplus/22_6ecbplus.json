At a hearing on Tuesday, assistant district attorney Gail Fairman described 43 - year - old Yvonne Hiller as a \u201c methodical killer \u201d who waved a gun within a foot of a security guard \u2019 s face to regain access to the plant less than ten minutes after she had been escorted out. \u201c She returned like a grim reaper, \u201d says ADA Fairman, \u201c and she only shot the ones that she held responsible for her suspension. \u201d Fairman says that when Hiller found a group of co - workers in a break room, she allowed one person to leave unharmed. \u201c At one point, there was a co - worker holding onto Latoya Brown, \u201d says Fairman, \u201c and the defendant ordered that worker away, and then she shot Brown. \u201d Hiller had repeated run - ins with co - workers, whom she accused of spraying her with a deer scent, among other things (see related story). Two women were pronounced dead at the scene, and a male co - worker was wounded. A detective testified during the preliminary hearing about Hiller \u2019 s statement to police, claiming people had been spraying her for years. The defense would not comment on strategy plans for the trial.", "title": "Accused Philadelphia Kraft Foods Killer Held For Trial.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / philadelphia. cbslocal.com / 2010 / 12 / 07 / accused - philadelphia - kraft - foods - killer - held - for - trial /"}
