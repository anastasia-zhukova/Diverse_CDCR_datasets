At this point it is unclear if the shooting had anything to do with the approaching anniversary of the 9 - 11 attacks on America by radical members of the Muslim faith. However it does seem odd that Hiller had a. 357 Magnum in her car, which is what she used. That \u2019 s a pretty heavy - duty gun.
