The shooting happened moments after the employee, Yvonne Hiller, was suspended from her job at Kraft, where she \u2019 d worked for 15 years, the Daily News reports. After being escorted from the snack plant, she re - entered 10 minutes later with a handgun. About 100 people were in the building when she began shooting. Hiller was taken into custody after a standoff with the SWAT team. A Kraft representative confirmed Hiller is now in police custody and that one of the wounded employees is in the hospital. \u201c This is a sad time for the Kraft Foods family, \u201d a statement reads. \u201c We are working closely with the authorities as they investigate this situation, and our facility is closed until further notice. \u201d Unfortunately, the most surprising aspect of this incident is the shooter \u2019 s gender. Women shooters are rare but may be on the rise. In February, a woman opened fire at the University of Alabama, killing three and injuring several others. Reportedly, she was a professor whose tenure had been denied.
