A total of three cables linking Italy and Egypt went down. A ship has been sent out to fix the problems. Currently, services are being rerouted to backup cables and satellites. As rerouting measures fully kick in, services are expected to improve by early Saturday morning. This is n't the first time that cable service to the region has failed. Earlier this year, five separate undersea cables were cut between late January and early February, interrupting service to a number of countries. There's likely to be some serious failure analysis involved if we see some more pipes go off-line in the next week.", "title": "Internet service in Egypt, the UAE, India and other counties in the region was interrupted today when submarine cables in the Mediterranean Sea failed.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
