DeShawn Wynn and Joique Bell are in. Suddenly, the No. 5 Saints don \u2019 t look as quite as big a threat to make a repeat trip to the Super Bowl. One day after Chris Ivory was surprisingly lost for the season, the Saints placed Thomas on injured reserve. The team \u2019 s best running back also sat out in Week 17. Coach Sean Payton said Thomas suffered a setback in practice last week. We \u2019 ve been toying with the idea of picking the Saints to make it back to the Super Bowl. They \u2019 ve turned the ball over too much, but their defense is a lot better than people think. This news makes it harder. It \u2019 s going to be a lot harder for the New Orleans offense to stay balanced with Reggie Bush and Julius Jones carrying the load. Wynn and Bell were added to the roster in the last two days, but figure to be reserves.", "title": "Pierre Thomas is headed to injured reserve.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / profootballtalk. nbcsports.com / 2011 / 01 / 05 / pierre - thomas - is - headed - to - injured - reserve /"}
