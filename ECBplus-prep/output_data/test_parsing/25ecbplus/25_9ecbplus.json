Thomas has an ankle injury, and he is the second running back in two days to be placed on IR as New Orleans prepares for its wild - card round playoff game at Seattle. The Saints placed rookie Chris Ivory on injured reserve Tuesday - - another huge blow, because he was the club's leading rusher this season. That leaves Reggie Bush, Julius Jones and the newly - signed Joique Bell, who was added off the Eagles' practice squad when Thomas was placed on IR, to carry the load in the Saints' backfield. The Saints do not generally run the ball much anyway - - New Orleans finished 30th in the NFL in rushing attempts this season, with 380. They do, however, use their running backs frequently out of the backfield in the short passing game, and Thomas' absence will hurt there. Ivory, who had made strides with ball security, showed off his power this season, running through arm tackles and over lighter linebackers en route to 716 yards rushing. Thomas was hurt in the Saints' game vs. Atlanta game in September and missed 10 games, including last Sunday's loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. New Orleans has never used Reggie Bush as a feature - type back, but as more of a third - down, all - purpose running back. It is likely he will get 10 to 12 carries on Saturday. The Saints are not likely to expose him to more than that, not with the depth being in such critical shape. There was good news for New Orleans : Wide receiver Marques Colston was a full participant in practice on Wednesday. He did not play last Sunday after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery last Tuesday. Safety Malcolm Jenkins (knee), tight end Jimmy Graham (ankle), defensive tackle Anthony Hargrove (knee) and linebacker Danny Clark (hamstring) did not participate in team drills Wednesday. It is not certain what their status is for Saturday. Tight end Jeremy Shockey (groin) and tight end David Thomas (knee) were limited in Wednesday's practice, which is encouraging because of Graham's ankle injury.", "title": "Pierre Thomas Placed on Injured Reserve.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / www. aolnews.com / 2011 / 01 / 05 / pierre - thomas - placed - on - injured - reserve /"}
