Here \u2019 s the story from my buddy Mike Tripplett over at the New Orleans Times - Picayune. In the Saints 17 - 14 victory over the Falcons on Dec. 27, Thomas rushed for 63 yards and scored on a 2 - yard touchdown in the second quarter. He joins the team \u2019 s top rusher, Chris Ivory, on the injured reserve. It looks like Reggie Bush will have to carry the rushing load. They also recently signed rookie Joique Bell (Wayne State) from the Philadelphia Eagles \u2019 practice squad. They also signed veteran DeShawn Wynn (Florida) on Tuesday to serve as a backup behind Bush and Julius Jones. If the Saints beat Seattle and Philadelphia beats Green Bay, the Falcons will face the Saints at 8 p. m. Saturday, Jan. 15 at the Georgia Dome.", "title": "LIKELY FOE : Saints suffer major injury, Thomas to IR.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / blogs. ajc.com / atlanta - falcons - blog / 2011 / 01 / 05 / likely - foe - saints - suffer - major - injury - thomas - to - ir /"}
