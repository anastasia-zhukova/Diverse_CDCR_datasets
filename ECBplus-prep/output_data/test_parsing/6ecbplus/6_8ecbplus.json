They have also been very understanding of me through this difficult decision. \" The second film in the Hunger Games trilogy is scheduled to hit theaters in November of 2013, allowing the studio and creators a limited window to prepare before production would need to begin.", "title": "Gary Ross Will Not Direct 'Hunger Games' Sequel.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / www. rollingstone.com / movies / news / gary - ross - will - not - direct - hunger - games - sequel - 20120411"}
