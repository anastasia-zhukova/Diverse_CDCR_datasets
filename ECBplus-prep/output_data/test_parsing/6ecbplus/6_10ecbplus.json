The three leads Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Liam Hemsworth are already signed on to appear in the sequel and, no doubt, the third film \u2018 Mockingjay \u2019 as well. The biggest player who doesn \u2019 t have a deal in place is director Gary Ross and The Hollywood Reporter and Collider are reporting that he is in negotiations with Lionsgate to return. Hit the jump for more details and how \u2018 Catching Fire \u2019 could face a huge delay. Allegedly, Ross was paid $3 million to direct \u2018 The Hunger Games \u2019 plus five per cent on the back end. With no deal in place for Ross to direct future films in the series, he is in a good position to ask for more money. There is no doubt that Ross was instrumental in making \u2018 The Hunger Games \u2019 a huge success. It was his direction that many critics applauded and brought the film down to earth, as opposed to the bloated spectacle it could have become in the wrong hands. Lionsgate can \u2019 t hide that they don \u2019 t have the money, but they have to spend it wisely to ensure the quality of the franchise continues and Ross could get a good deal out of it. Of course, if Ross wants too much money Lionsgate could easily give him the flick and hire a new director similar to the \u2018 Harry Potter \u2019 and \u2018 Twilight \u2019 films. Considering Lionsgate recently absorbed Summit and their executives (masters of the \u2018 Twilight \u2019 films) into team Lionsgate ; a change in director could be likely. Another tough challenge facing Lionsgate with the production of \u2018 Catching Fire \u2019 is the possibility of delays due to the schedule of Lawrence. \u2018 Catching Fire \u2019 has a release date of 22 November 2013 with production starting later in the year. Lawrence is set to star in the sequel to \u2018 X - Men : First Class \u2019 that could go into production soon if Fox decide to exercise Lawrence \u2019 s option to do the sequel. The \u2018 X - Men : First Class \u2019 sequel already has a director with Matthew Vaughn returning and Fox might rush it into production to capitalise on Lawrence \u2019 s star power.", "title": "Gary Ross in negotiations to direct \u2018 Hunger Games \u2019 sequel \u2018 Catching Fire \u2019.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / thepopcornjunkie.com / 2012 / 04 / 05 / gary - ross - in - negotiations - to - direct - hunger - games - sequel - catching - fire /"}
