While Microsoft claims that it has received reports of attacks aimed at Internet Explorer 8 and 9, it appears that the security flaw affects all the other versions of the browser. According to the company, the issue would allow remote code execution, which means that an attacker could get access to an unpatched system by directing users to a compromised website. \u201c This issue could allow remote code execution if an affected system browses to a website containing malicious content directed towards the specific browser type. This would typically occur when an attacker compromises the security of trusted websites regularly frequented, or convinces someone to click on a link in an email or instant message, \u201d the company explained. The Fix It tool released by Microsoft can be used for IE6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 on Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1, both Preview and RTM. 32 - and 64 - bit versions of the operating systems are all included in the security advisory. In addition, the tech giant recommends users to set Internet and local intranet security zone settings to \u201c High \u201d in order to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones. \u201c This will help prevent exploitation but may affect usability ; therefore, trusted sites should be added to the Internet Explorer Trusted Sites zone to minimize disruption, \u201d Microsoft said. At the same time, the Softies suggest that it would be a good idea to configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting completely in the Internet and local intranet security zones, just to be sure that everyone is on the safe side and no successful attacks are possible.", "title": "Microsoft Launches Emergency Patch for Internet Explorer.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / news. softpedia.com / news / Microsoft - Launches - Emergency - Patch - for - Internet - Explorer - 383865. shtml"}
