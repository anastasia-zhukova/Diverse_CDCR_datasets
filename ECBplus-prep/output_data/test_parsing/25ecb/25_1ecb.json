Bush was hurt last Thursday in a 27-24 loss to Chicago. The Saints are 7-7 and were eliminated from playoff contention over the weekend. The third-year star from Southern California was the team's second-leading rusher and receiver this season, despite missing four games to recover from arthroscopic surgery for a knee injury suffered in an October 19 game against Carolina. Bush will finish the year with 404 yards rushing and a pair of touchdowns, as well as 52 catches for 440 yards and four scores. He also returned three punts for touchdowns. The Saints signed cornerback Michael Lehan to fill the vacant roster spot.", "title": "Saints place Bush on IR.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
