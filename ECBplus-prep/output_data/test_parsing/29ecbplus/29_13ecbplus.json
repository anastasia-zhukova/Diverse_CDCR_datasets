They lost to a fourth quarter Colt stampede 20 - 13. This time it was coach Romeo Crennel \u2019 s fault. There they were on the Colts 27 - yard line with inches to go for a first down and Crennel decides to go for it. He should have played it safe with a field goal. They blew it on a quarterback sneak. They handed the ball over to the Colts at the 27 - yard line and the Colts took it back down the field for a fourth quarter touchdown and won the game. This was a game that saw a great performance by their running backs Jamaal Charles and former Razorback Peyton Hillis. Charles turned in a 86 - yard touchdown run and rushed for a total of 226 yards and Hillis rushed for more than a hundred yards. Put it all together and the Chiefs gained 507 yards and still managed \u2014 through penalties, interceptions and fumbles \u2014 to lose the game. Astounding! This gave the Colts a 9 - 5 season and eligibility for the playoffs. I guess it \u2019 s possible to put together a team that so consistently shoots itself in the foot, but the Chiefs are an incredible collection of screwups with a few brilliant players who come out every week and make it look like it might be a football team. But are usually thwarted by the goofups ; some must come off that field shaking their heads and fondering in frustration. This is the Chiefs \u2019 last home game of the season, and it would have been nice if they could have won it. Oh well, next week they journey to Denver to take on the Broncos in their mile high city with their rarified air. Denver is not going to be a pushover. The Broncos are 12 - 3 for the season after defeating the Cleveland Browns 34 - 12 Sunday. Denver is up for the number one seed and the Chiefs down in the basement with a 2 - 13 season.
