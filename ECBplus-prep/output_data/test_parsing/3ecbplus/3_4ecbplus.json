During the escape, Arcade Joseph Comeaux, Jr. allegedly produced a weapon and fired upon two correctional officers, took them hostage and forced them to drive to Baytown, Texas, where he restrained the officers in the back of the van, took their firearms and one of their uniforms. Comeaux \u2019 s escape is all the more surprising since authorities had mistakenly believed he was paralyzed following a stroke, and was wheelchair bound. Comeaux fled on foot following his escape. Comeaux was in prison after being convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. According to Texas authorities, the weapons conviction stemmed from a 1999 incident where he stabbed his wife 17 times while she was visiting him in prison.", "title": "Texas Prison Escapee Added to U.S. Marshals '15 Most Wanted' List.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / www. justice. gov / marshals / investigations / most _ wanted / comeaux / comeaux. htm"}
