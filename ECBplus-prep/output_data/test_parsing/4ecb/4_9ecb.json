Personally, I was n't surprised because I thought she died several years ago. Page is best known by her fans for her risque bondage films and pictures, and her infamous sense of style, which continues to influence everyone from mortician Goth girls to rockabilly cholas in my high school to Dita Von Teese, who's complete act is utterly ripped off from her.

Without her, the Suicide Girls would n't exist, although it's questionable whether that's a real loss. I chose the above picture to memorialize her because everyone loves monkeys. RIP Bettie! I 'll drink a martini and listen to a Cramps song in your memory tonight.", "title": "Many people were shocked and saddened to learn that beloved pin-up icon Bettie Page passed away yesterday in Los Angeles after lingering in a coma for a week following a heart attack.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
