At around 4 : 30 a. m. local time (11.30 p. m. ET) the thieves rammed an SUV into the front of the Casty store, near the prestigious Place Vendome, a well - known square in the center of the French capital that is home to a number of jewelers and high - end stores. After scooping up jewelry and watches estimated to be worth 2 million euros ($2.6 million) the thieves reversed their car out of the store and set fire to it before making off in another vehicle, Le Monde reported. The raid comes little over a month after a masked bandit made off with an $136M worth of diamonds and jewels from the Carlton Intercontinental Hotel in Cannes on the glamorous French Riviera, in possibly the world \u2019 s biggest heist. A lone robber entered through a French door at the side of the building on the famed La Croisette seafront, scooped up the loot and then jumped out of another window. Despite a huge police investigation, the audacious culprit remains at large. Thieves also targeted the annual Cannes film festival, stealing almost $2 million of jewelry from the safe in the hotel room of an American jeweler working for Chopard, one of Switzerland \u2019 s most famous diamond merchants. Days later a $2.5 million necklace was lifted by a crook at a movie industry party at the even more exclusive resort of Cap d \u2019 Antibes, near the Italian border.", "title": "Crooks at $2.6 million heist on Paris jewelry store.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / www. ahametals.com / crooks - 2 - 6 - million - heist - paris /"}
