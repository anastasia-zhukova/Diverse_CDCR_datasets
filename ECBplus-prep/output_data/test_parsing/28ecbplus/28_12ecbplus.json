His body was discovered yesterday by a maid who entered his hotel room in Biloxi. Coroner Gary Hargrove said he believes that Mr. LaRue died Saturday. Mr. LaRue was known as the \"bagman\" who delivered payoffs to keep participants in the Watergate break - in quiet. He served four months in federal prison for conspiracy to obstruct justice. Mr. LaRue served as special assistant to Mitchell, who later headed President Nixon's reelection committee. Mr. LaRue was present at a 1972 meeting with Mitchell and Nixon aide Jeb Stuart Magruder at Nixon's vacation home in Key Biscayne, Fla., where the plan to break into the Watergate complex in Washington was allegedly hatched. Mr. LaRue said he advised against the burglarization of the building, which housed Democratic Party headquarters. After his political career ended in scandal, Mr. LaRue returned to his home state of Mississippi to work in his family's oil company and with its real estate holdings. He also spent much time catching shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico. A few researchers of the scandal have suggested that Mr. LaRue could have been Deep Throat. He discounted those rumors, saying the mysterious source for Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate story was not one person, but probably a combination of several people.", "title": "Fred LaRue, 75 ; delivered 'hush' money in Watergate.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / www. boston.com / news / globe / obituaries / articles / 2004 / 07 / 28 / fred _ larue _ 75 _ delivered _ hush _ money _ in _ watergate /? camp=pm"}
