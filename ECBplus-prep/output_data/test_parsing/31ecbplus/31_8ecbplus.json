Eight teams competed in the quarterfinal round, and we've already had one memorable last - second game. Now there's just four teams left fighting for the automatic bid on Saturday. Let's recap Friday's action. Doug McDermott put on a show as usual, scoring 23 points and becoming the school's all - time leader in points scored. He had help from his teammates, as well, as Gregory Echenique finished with a double - double (11 points, 11 rebounds). The Bulldgos never let this game turn into a blowout, but they never came close enough to make Creighton sweat, either. The Bluejays will play Indiana State on Saturday.", "title": "2013 MVC Tournament results and bracket : Creighton, Wichita St. move on.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / www. sbnation.com / college - basketball / 2013 / 3 / 8 / 4081296 / missouri - valley - conference - 2013 - basketball - tournament - results - bracket"}
