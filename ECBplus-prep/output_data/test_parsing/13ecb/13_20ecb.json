Five women, and possibly a couple of children, were inside the church working on crafts, but everyone got out safely after a fire alarm alerted them to trouble, Steele said. It was the biggest fire the department has seen this year, and Steele said as many as 35 to 40 volunteer firefighters came from across the region to battle the blaze.", "title": "Authorities suspect arson is the cause of a fire that caused an estimated $ 1 million in damage to Gov.
