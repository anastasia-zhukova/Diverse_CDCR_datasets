The head of Microsoft's security response team says all users of Internet Explorer should test and install the update as soon as possible.

Microsoft says less than 1 per cent of Australian PC users have been affected by the problem.", "title": "Microsoft releases emergency patch for IE.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
