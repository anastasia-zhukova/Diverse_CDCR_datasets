Williams, 32, was pulled over for speeding in his Bentley on State Route 94 around 1 : 30 a. m. on February 1, but was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving. He had refused a Breathalyzer test and was given a blood - alcohol test instead. The results from the test were released Wednesday and showed a level of 0.07 percent - - just under the California legal limit of 0.08 percent. CHP Officer Brian Pennings said that the blood had been drawn well after Williams' arrest, meaning he could have been intoxicated when officers had pulled him over. City Attorney spokeswoman Gina Coburn said the case remains under review and is being investigated further.", "title": "Hey, Jamal Williams : Hire a Driver!", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / www. nbcsandiego.com / news / sports / Hey - Jamal - Williams - Hire - a - Driver. html"}
