The fire service was called at approximately 06 : 00 BST to the store, which is on Wellington \u2019 s high street. Upon arrival they found that the roof fire was quite significant. Fire crews from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue attended the scene and then called a further four appliances to help, a report from ITV revealed. They contained the fire to one corner of the roof but could not be extinguished before a part of the entrance building collapsed. However, the main area of the one - storey supermarket was left largely intact with only smoke damage. By about 09 : 30 BST the fire was largely out, with crews checking for hotspots. The fire service \u2019 s Matt Goodman explained that the fire began on the outside of the building. \"It then quickly spread to the roof so there is a significant amount of damage to the roof, but thankfully due to the early actions of the Wellington crew we could get a large weight of response to the scene, \u201d he said. \"We've been able to prevent it spreading to other areas of the building, so the main store on the inside has got a reasonably small amount of smoke damage. \" A spokesperson from Waitrose explained that no one was hurt in the incident and was grateful to the emergency services for their quick response and effective help. Investigations into what caused the fire are ongoing. In a bid to remove potential fire hazards, commercial buildings and non - domestic premises in England and Wales are already forced to undertake a 'suitable and sufficient' fire risk assessment carried out under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005. While the overwhelming majority of premises do this, if the assessment is thought to have been carried out to an insufficient extent, the Responsible Person can face an unlimited fine or up to two years in prison.", "title": "Waitrose in Wellington catches fire.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": "http : / / www. fia. uk.com / en / Information / Details / index. cfm / Waitrose - in - Wellington - catches - fire"}
