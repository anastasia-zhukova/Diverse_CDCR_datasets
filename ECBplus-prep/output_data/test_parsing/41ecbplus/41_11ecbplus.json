There appeared to be no casualties. The Reuters correspondent heard a large explosion, then saw a crater about two metres (6.6 feet) wide, an unexploded bomb wedged in the side of a school building and a white aircraft flying north from the Yida refugee camp. Witnesses at the camp said there were three other explosions at 3 p. m.
