In addition to the iPod Classic, Nano and Shuffle, they have announced the brand new iPod touch, a media player which mimics the iPhone's touch-screen capabilities. The new iPod Classic design features a larger memory space of up to 160GB or 40,000 songs, and has a new all-metal design. The iPod nano is now smaller and squarer, adding video playback to its features for the first time. The 4GB model is cheaper than its predecessor at $ 149 / \u00a3 99, but the 8GB is available in five colours at $ 199 / \u00a3 129. The iPod Shuffle is identical in design to the previous model, but is now available in a new range of five colours, with the same price of $ 79 / \u00a3 49. The iPod touch also features in-built wi-fi technology, enabling users to access the internet and download music from Apple's market-leading on line iTunes music store to their handset. It was announced that Starbucks would offer free wi-fi access to all users of the iPod touch in its cafes. The screen layout, similar to that of the iPhone, offers access to music, video, photos and the iTunes store. There are currently two models, at 8GB and 16GB of memory capacity. Apple CEO Steve Jobs also announced that the price of Apple's iPhone, currently only on sale in the US, will be cut by $ 200 to $ 399. He described the new iPod range as` one of the seven wonders of the world'.", "title": null, "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
