Japan's (ANA) were to take delivery in May 2008, but will now receive the aircraft next month. The plane promises increased fuel efficiency as it is the first model to be built out of plastic and carbon composites, more lightweight than conventional materials. Boeing says they have 800 orders at 200 million per aircraft. Launch customer ANA have ordered 55. Delayed by Boeing's outsourcing system to a variety of subcontractors, two models have been developed. The 787-8 holds between 210 and 250 passengers ; the 787-9 holds 250 to 290. Airlines choose the seating layout they want. After the 787, already bearing ANA's livery, arrives in Tokyo next month, the airline will use its first commercial flight for a special charter from Tokyo to Hong Kong. \"We plan to use the 787 to expand our business, particularly our international routes, '' says ANA senior vice president Mitsuo Morimoto. \"We plan to increase our revenue from international route significantly and the 787 will play an instrumental role in this, '' he adds, noting flights to Europe or the US are possibles for 787s. \"We are rolling out the first delivery airplane, the first 787, '' enthused Scott Fancher, 787 project manager and Boeing vice president. \"That's an amazing thing for those who have worked on the program five, six, seven years, here at Boeing and our partners around the world. '' Boeing says they must increase the tempo of production from two a month to ten, if they are to meet customer demand. \"It's an extraordinary challenge, no one has ever built a wide body aircraft at the rate of 10 per month before, '' claims writer John Ostrower.", "title": null, "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
