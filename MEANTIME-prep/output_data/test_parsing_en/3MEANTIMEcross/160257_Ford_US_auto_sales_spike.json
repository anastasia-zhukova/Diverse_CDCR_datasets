Ford said that total sales improved to 142,285 units, compared to 141,951 units sold by GM. Additionally, Ford said that its share of the total US car market rose to 17 %, up from 14 % a year ago. The increase was better than analysts had predicted, and Ford's stock rose to a five-year high in morning trading, before declining later in the day. Ford's sales were significantly influenced by a 74 % increase in fleet sales to businesses. Rental car agencies alone accounted for around 30,000 units sold. Sales to retail consumers increased only 28 %. The increases were led by sales of two sedans, the Fusion and Taurus, which rose 166.5 and 93.3 % respectively, although sales of other models such as SUVs and pickup trucks also increased. Both models were significantly redesigned last year, and analysts said that improved quality from such cars were driving the increases. Other companies also reported February sales today, nearly all reporting sales gains as well, although none as large as those of Ford. Toyota was the sole exception to the sales gains, as their sales declined 8.7 %, as the company was faced with a global recall during the month that led to a temporary stoppage of production for some models. \"The strength of our new products ... are resonating with customers, '' said Ken Czubay, Ford's vice president of sales and marketing. However, he believed that traditional Toyota customers were not buying rival autos, but rather awaiting the results from the recalls.", "title": "Ford US auto sales spike.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
