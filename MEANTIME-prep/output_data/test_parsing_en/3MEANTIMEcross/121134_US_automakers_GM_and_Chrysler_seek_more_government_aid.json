At the end of last year, the auto maker had just over 54,000 employees, meaning that the layoffs will equal about six percent of its total workforce. In addition, Chrysler will cut the Chrysler Aspen, PT Cruiser, and Durango from production. Another automaker, General Motors (GM), announced that it seeks $ 16.6 billion in loans from the government, in addition to the $ 13.4 billion that it has already received. GM plans to lay off 47,000 employees and close five factories. GM says that it might need as much as $ 30 billion from the US Treasury Department, an increase over their previous estimate of $ 18 billion. The company has warned that it might run out of money by March if more aid was not given. Rick Wagoner, GM's chief executive, described the firm's plan as \"comprehensive, responsive, achievable, and flexible '' . \"We have a lot of work in front of us, but I am confident it will result in a profitable General Motors, '' he said, adding that \"today's plan is significantly more aggressive because it has to be. '' GM says that it could be profitable in two years' time, and might be able to repay all its loans by 2017. A third US car manufacturer, Ford Motor Company, has said that it can make it through this year without any government aid. The US Treasury Department will review the car makers' survival plans for several weeks before a decision is made on whether or not to extend the loans. That decision is due by the end of next month.", "title": "US automakers GM and Chrysler seek more government aid.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
