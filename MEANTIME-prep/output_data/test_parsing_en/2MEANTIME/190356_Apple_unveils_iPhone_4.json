The announcement was long-awaited but not a very big surprise. In April, the technology blog Gizmodo obtained a prototype of the new phone and published details of it online. While introducing iPhone 4, at the annual conference, Jobs started by hinting at the incident, saying, \"Stop me if you 've already seen this. \"The new iPhone was praised by Jobs as \"the biggest leap we 've taken since the original iPhone. \"It is only 9.3 millimetres (0.37 inches) thick, making it \"the thinnest smartphone on the planet \", a 24 percent reduction from Apple's previous model, the iPhone 3GS. Structure-wise, iPhone 4 has a new stainless steel frame, which acts as an antenna, supposedly boosting its signal reception abilities and possibly reducing the amount of dropped calls. It also has a new screen, dubbed a \"retina display, \"which displays images at 326 pixels per inch. During the keynote, Jobs demoed the device's new internal gyroscope as well. Even though it now uses Apple's faster A4 processor (first used in its iPad tablet), iPhone 4 has a claimed seven hours of 3G talk time, up two hours from the 3GS. In addition to its design features, Jobs showed off iPhone 4's new video calling abilities. This feature is called FaceTime, and connects with other iPhone 4s via Wi-Fi. The phone has two cameras : one on the front for video chats, and one on the back for taking pictures and other videos. The rear camera has a resolution of five megapixels, is capable of recording high-definition video, and has an LED flash. The iPhone 4 will use Apple's latest mobile operating system, iOS 4. Formerly \"iPhone OS, \"iOS 4 was first introduced by Apple in April, and includes multitasking capabilities. Jobs called the new software \"the most advanced mobile operating system in the world. \"iOS will support Apple's new mobile advertising service, iAd, which goes live on July 1. iPhone 4 will be available on June 24 in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. It comes in two colors -- black and white -- and two storage capacities. The 16GB version is priced at US $ 199 and the 32GB version at US $ 299. The iPhone 3GS's price will be reduced to US $ 99, and the iPhone 3G will be discontinued. iOS will be available as a free software update to users of compatible older Apple devices (including the 3GS) on June 21. In the U.S., iPhone 4 will only be available on AT&T's cellular network, despite calls for Apple to let the iPhone be used on other carriers, such as Verizon. Competition-wise, the BlackBerry mobile device is still the most popular smartphone right now. Apple is also facing some serious competition from web giant Google's Android operating system, as well as Palm's webOS. Earlier this year, Android phones managed to outsell iPhones. iPhone users, however, account for over half of those surfing the Internet on a mobile browser in the U.S. Jobs also noted that over five billion iOS applications, commonly called \"apps, \"have been purchased from Apple's App Store. The App Store currently has around 225,000 different apps for sale.", "title": "Apple unveils iPhone 4.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
