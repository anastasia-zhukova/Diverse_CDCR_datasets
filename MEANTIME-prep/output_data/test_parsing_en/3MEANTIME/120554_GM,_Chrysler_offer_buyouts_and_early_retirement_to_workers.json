The automobile manufacturers have been hard hit in the recent economic downturn and have been forced to seek federal aid from the U.S. government. Reports say that GM's package includes a $ 20,000 cash payment and a $ 25,000 new vehicle voucher. Chrysler will offer a $ 25,000 vehicle voucher and $ 50,000 with healthcare and $ 75,000 without. Both will offer the deal to most United Auto Workers (UAW) union members - 62,000 at GM, which is seeking to cut 31,500 jobs by 2012. The two companies have received $ 13.4 billion in federal loans to keep them operating, but Congress required them to produce viability plans to demonstrate they were making significant cost cuts and labor concessions in return for the money. UAW workers in Detroit earn $ 28 an hour ; their replacements will earn about half that. The UAW's \"jobs bank '' , a system where workers without duties are still paid, has stopped at both companies. GM is also attempting to engineer a debt-for-equity swap, reducing its liabilities from $ 27.5 billion in unsecured debt to $ 9.2 billion. It is also seeking to sell a truck manufacturer, the Delco Electronics parts group and the Hummer and Saab Automobile vehicle brands. The entire motor manufacturing sector has suffered under the economic downturn, with the Ford Motor Company announcing a $ 14.6 billion annual loss, although it has not sought federal aid. GM and Chrysler both ran out of operating funds in December, leading to the federal bailout.", "title": "GM, Chrysler offer buyouts and early retirement to workers.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
