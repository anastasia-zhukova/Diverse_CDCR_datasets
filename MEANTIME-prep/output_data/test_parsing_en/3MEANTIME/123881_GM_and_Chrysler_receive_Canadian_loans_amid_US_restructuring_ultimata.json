We are doing this on the assumption that we obviously can not afford either in the United States or Canada a catastrophic short-term collapse. '' said Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada. \"We can not, we must not, and we will not let our auto industry simply vanish. This industry is, like no other, an emblem of the American spirit ; a once and future symbol of America's success, '' said Barack Obama, President of the United States. \"These companies - and this industry - must ultimately stand on their own, not as wards of the state. '' Chrysler will receive CA$ 1 billion and may in fact be eligible for as much as CA$ 4 billion. If Chrysler succeeds in the next 30 days with a restructuring plan it would be eligible for a US$ 6 billion loan. A part of Chrysler's restructuring plan must include a partnership with Fiat within 30 days to appease the US administration. Fiat is a supplier of smaller fuel-efficient vehicles, and the merger will help Chrysler to be viable in the North American market. A Chrysler court bankruptcy would inevitably lead to it being sold off. As a part of Chrysler's restructuring plans, Tom LaSorda, the president of Chrysler announced that Canadian operations would fold if it does not receive both the US commitment of $ 2.3 billion of aid and a new Canadian Auto Workers CAW contract to reduce all-in costs by CA$ 19 per hour. As a result of this announcement Chrysler's auto sales volume in Canada dropped 23 % compared to March of 2008. GM has until the end of May to restructure its company to receive up to CA$ 7.5 billion. As part of the companies restructuring, General Motor's chief executive Rick Wagoner was replaced Sunday with Fritz Henderson, the current chief operating officer. Henderson spoke out on Tuesday that GM has submitted a restructuring plan which would close five plants, and this may be increased to meet the requirements for financial aid. He is in full compliance with Obama's auto task force to seek bankruptcy if GM can not negotiate with their unions, bondholders and others. GM recently brought forward the \"GM Total Confidence '' program providing consumer purchase protection for customers who lose their job for economic reasons within the first two years from purchase. As a result of Chrysler's restructuring announcement in Canada, GM's Canadian vehicle sales volume fell only 17.3 % compared to 2008, an increase from the previous month. GM must reduce some of its legacy costs which include its pensions and union health care costs. A part of GM's ailments arose from investing in supplying truck and SUVs during an economy of high gas prices when consumers were demanding fuel efficient vehicles. Tony Clement, Canada's Minister of Industry, is hoping that the CAW will support the restructuring process and re-negotiate their agreement. Whereas a United Auto Workers negotiator has said, \"I do n't see how the UAW will do anything until they see what the bondholders will give up. '' The Obama administration is looking toward bankruptcy proceedings for the automakers, \"as a mechanism to help them restructure quickly and emerge stronger. It will] quickly clear away old debts that are weighing them down. What we are asking is difficult. It will require hard choices by companies. It will require unions and workers who have already made painful concessions to make even more. It will require creditors to recognise that they can not hold out for the prospect of endless government bailouts. '' said Obama. The auto parts suppliers and IT software exporters in India have already been affected by the declining auto sales. GM and Chrysler software contracts provide US$ 300 to 350 million a year to vendors in India. As well these two major automakers usually award US$ 1 billion contracts to auto parts suppliers. \"We are worried and closely watching the developments in the US to gauge the impact. The decline in auto sales in the US has already hit the order books of Indian suppliers, '' said a Delhi auto parts supplier. \"Going forward, the industry will undoubtedly be smaller, but if our efforts are successful it will be viable and it will support good jobs for Canadians, '' said Clements. Betty Sutton, Ohio's Congresswoman put forward the CARS act which provides a US$ 3,000 to 5,000 incentive for those who trade in their vehicle for a fuel-efficient car. \"It clearly stimulates the economy, and it gets the consumer into the showroom and gets them buying again. But importantly -- and this is what I particularly like about it -- it really helps the environment quite a bit in two respects. '' said William Clay Ford Jr., executive chairman of Ford Motor Co.. Ford Motor Company has not come forward with requests for assistance. Since December GM and Chrysler have received US$ 17.4 billion government loans.", "title": "GM and Chrysler receive Canadian loans amid US restructuring ultimata.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
