Air Canada has ordered US$ 6 billion in new airliners, while Air India has signed a deal for a further US$ 7 billion. The Air Canada deal includes firm orders for 18 777s and 14 of the new mid-size, long-range 787 Dreamliner. Options are included for 18 more 777s and 46 more 787s. The Air India order is worth US$ 6.8 billion for 50 787s. Air India says the new fuel-efficient airliner will save US$ 300 million in fuel a year, while Air Canada has estimated a 30 % fuel saving over their existing 767s. Air India have also said that the 20 extra seats the 787 offers over a similarly-sized Airbus A330 was a decisive factor. Korean Air also bought 20 Dreamliners earlier this month. Boeing now has a total of 237 orders and commitments for the 787. The Boeing 777 is a family of long range widebody twin engine airliners built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It carries between 305 and 550 passengers and has a range from 5,600 to 8,870 nautical miles (10,400 to 16,400 km). The first flight of the 777 was in 1994. The Boeing 787, or Dreamliner, is a mid-sized passenger airliner currently under development by Boeing Commercial Airplanes and scheduled to enter service in 2008. It will carry between 200 and 350 passengers depending on the seating configuration, and be more fuel-efficient than earlier airliners. In addition, it will be the first major airliner to use composite material in the majority of its construction.", "title": "Boeing secures 11bn of aircraft deals.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
